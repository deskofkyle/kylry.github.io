<h1>30,000 Words: Here’s What I Didn’t Expect from a Computer Science Degree</h1>

<p>These 30,000 words were written during a 18-month period in 2016 and 2017. This is a reflection on the college process and getting a job in technology. </p>

<p>The purpose of this is to help other students navigate an undergraduate Computer Science education in the United States. This document is full of stories and lessons from my past four years in context of Computer Science and technology. I received a double-major degree is Computer Science and Psychology at the University of Rochester. I had 3 internships, 5 contract software jobs, 1 teaching assistant position. I lived in Rochester for school, New York City for an internship, and San Francisco for two internships. </p>

<h1>Who is this for?</h1>

<p>At first, I thought this would be purely for posterity. It has been a long four years with a lot of lessons and growth. However, I feel that many newcomers, fresh to the university process or otherwise, would find benefit from my writing. The most important population of readers are high school students that are eager to enter a Computer Science program at a top university. </p>

<p>If I think back to anyone I would want to write this for, it would be for “the me 4 years ago”. To explain further, there are a lot of things that I did not know four years ago that I have recorded in this. I will maintain that this is the audience for this, even though a lot of other people will read it. Therefore during the, you might find me saying things like, “you should do this”. You an assume that the “you” in this context is both the reader (you) and me as a 17 year old in high school. </p>

<p>Sure, a good amount of this does contain generalizable information about the college process. However, most of this has to do with specific things I learned about Computer Science undergraduate education, as applied to the field of technology for graduation. </p>

<p>Was I successful in college? Yes and no. On the whole, I navigated the complex job-process and maintained around 7 technical internships &amp; jobs during college. I also managed to get a double major degree — satisfying both the Computer Science and Psychology requirements for the bachelors degrees. On the other side with any of my failures at college, I attempted to turn these failures into opportunities to learn about myself and improve. Therefore, most bad things about college turned into good things, since I was able to learn lessons and apply them to my growth as a software engineer, student, and friend. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, you have to make the best choices for you. It is vitally important that you make decisions that you self-endorse. You should step back and ask yourself, am I endorsing my behavior? Would I endorse what I am about to do? If the answer is no, you are likely not at the steering wheel. As with advice, it does not matter what I tell you to do with your time at college. What matters most is that you are making your own decisions about your outcomes. Be at the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Enjoy the advice in this, but make your own decisions and use it to inform your decisions (if you choose to). </p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The purpose of this is to help other students navigate an undergraduate Computer Science education in the United States. This is the narrative of the past four years. I received a double-major degree is Computer Science and Psychology at the University of Rochester. 3 internships. 5 contract software jobs. 1 teaching assistant position. </p>

<p>Instead of just talking about my experience in CS, I will talk about my life for the past four years. This includes my summers, my down time, and the outlook I have for the future. Of course then, this document is not purely about a CS education, but I think my story is better consumed as a whole compared to bite-sized chunks. If four years of undergraduate CS has taught me lessons, they fit within the following statements in the itemized list you see below. Most of these things (and not all) will be explained in the following pages of this document. You will not agree with every criticism, comment, or perspective in this document. That’s fine! However, use it to inform you choices and judgements, even if you choose not to take any of the advice. </p>

<p>There a few things I will probably not talk as much about. Specifically, I will shy away from temporary, micro-social issues at college. These experiences were specific to me, and my advice in overcoming them will likely not be of much benefit to you.<em>Like I mentioned before the purpose of this book is to help other students navigate a very strange, multi-year experience in undergraduate Computer Science education. </em></p>

<p>This is my general, rough outline of the overall lessons I learned in the past four years with respect to the undergraduate process. These items do not apply to every college, but they are the things I have experienced directly in the past four years at Rochester, that you may or may not experience yourself. </p>

<h2>Main Thoughts</h2>

<ol>
	<li><strong>College is disorganized </strong>: Even though I went to a university with a relatively small undergraduate population (5,000 undergrads / 5,000 grads), I found that the process of A-to-B for almost everything was not straightforward. When it came to choosing classes, meeting professors, choosing your major, looking into research, or getting funneled into summer internships, almost everything was something I had to <em>actively</em> seek to do. Of course I did not expect everything to be simple, but even something as straight-forward as getting paid for a Teaching Assistant job was a process of <em>hoop jumping</em>. This idea of hoop jumping is something that will come up time and time again in this document. There is a difference between being “unorganized” and being “disorganized”. College is definitely organized but perhaps not in the right ways. </li>
	<li><strong>Be proactive in talking with professors and other students. No matter what, don&#39;t embrace isolation (in your dorm room)</strong>: Talking to other students and professors was the last thing I wanted to do freshman year. Intent of focusing on my homework, grades, and job applications, I rarely left my dorm room. Even at the end of my degree, I struggled with this. It is difficult to make those social bonds, but once you do have them, you should embrace them wholeheartedly. </li>
	<li> <strong>Your classmates and professors will have a full-spectrum of personalities</strong>: In high school, I assumed that all of my college classmates would be similar to the Top 25% of my high school classmates (smart, brushed their hair, and did everything they were told). Instead, I have met kids from every spectrum of aptitude, passion, skill, and drive. This was both a good and bad thing in college. Not everyone is a brainiac. Not everyone is a math genius. Not everyone does the assigned reading. There are motivated kids, unmotivated kids, organized kids, and unorganized kids. The Top 25% of your high school class will not be the same as the student body of your college. There is a huge spectrum of personalities. Also, expect your professors to have a range of personalities (even weird ones). </li>
	<li><strong>As an undergrad, it is difficult to have your creativity be supported by students, professors, and faculty</strong>: It was something I had to deal with early. Often, there would be a new initiative I wanted to start, a hack-a-thon I wanted to organize, or a club I wanted to join. Unbeknown, there were going to be several layers of bureaucracy that made it difficult to do anything. With the size of the program, and the number of graduate students, it is very difficult to be supported creatively as an undergrad. If you work in research, come up with a cool app, or write a great paper, no one really cares. Of course, there are lots of exceptions to this. However, on a whole, with the size of your college, most people will not value your creative pursuits. There are likely 400 other students on campus whom they (i.e. students, professors, faculty) have to support. When you walk into school as a freshman, do not expect that other students or professors will be interested in your work. Of course, this could change over time as you begin to develop relationships, but it is a difficult truth to begin with. </li>
	<li><strong>Peer-relationships will be made and inevitably broken</strong>: Perhaps this is the most poetic of all items here. You will find times in college where you have a great peer friendship and then make some decision or get into a circumstance where they are no longer your peer. Due to the complex nature of interactions in college, it is likely that you will not have perfect peer relationships, but you may be an exception! As of yet, I have not found a fool-proof remedy to maintaining perfect peer relationship in college. Through the growth process, you naturally make good and bad decisions. <em>The only way to make good decisions is to make bad decisions, learn from them, and fail forward. </em> Do not go out of your way to make bad decisions of course, but on your journey through college, you will inevitably make decisions with your peers that you’ll regret. </li>
	<li><strong>Be a Teaching Assistant</strong>: Especially if you are a CS student, pick one of your favorite classes, get an A, and ask the professor if you can be a TA. You will learn how to work with people, how to succeed at that subject, and how to help other students who consider you to be an “expert” at that subject, since you are the teaching assistant. I was only a TA for one class my junior year, but I would have done this multiple times if I could. This is one important reason to keep your grades high — maybe the only reason for a CS student in tech who is not going to graduate school. TA-ships are invaluable. Less valuable than internships, but they will still teach you a lot. </li>
	<li> <strong>Mental health is severely underrated</strong>: As you will find out, a large amount of my first year-and-a-half of college was spent dealing with my mental health because I did not pay attention to it. I will talk about the events that lead to this in this document, including my time with the therapist in New York City. Beyond me, you will find that it is extremely easy to neglect mental health in college. The neglect of mental health in college is embedded in the culture. People will often not sleep, not socialize, and not have healthy mental behavior because they are controlled by a deadline or assignment. A university also gives you the autonomy to stay in your room all day if you choose. Since I was never trained on the recognition of detrimental mental health behaviors, it was hard to me to realize when my mental health was suffering. You may find something similar happen when you are at college, since the ignorance of mental health is often the byproduct of high-paced college culture. Of course, universities are modernizing their approach to mental health. There are many more resources availible today for student seeking the needs of mental health treatment. Part of the compounding detriments to mental health in college is the financial cost of your time. If you do experience detrimental mental health behaviors, then you will run into a compounding effect with the financial cost. You are not only have a detrimental mental health issue, but you are paying to be in this situation. Recognition and expression that you need help is the first step. Often, telling others (your parents) that you don’t like something or want to change something is crucial for a successful experience of mental health in college. </li>
	<li><strong>You will have a lot of “down-time”</strong>: This is one thing that I did not expect in college. In high school, I was busy almost everyday — sports, homework, science competitions. In college, you have to find things to do during “down-time”. If you don’t, you will likely go crazy. </li>
	<li><strong>It’s your job, you’re on your own</strong>: Eating and studying alone was probably my first notable observation of college. For the first time, I had choice over how I spent my time. There was no school bell; no one was telling me to tuck in my shirt or get to class. With the number of students at your university, you will probably find the phenomena I found: <strong>you’re on your own</strong>. Your choices to succeed to fail in college is likely up to you. No one is holding your hand or pushing you to achieve goals. There are too many students for any one person to push you to achieve certain goals or desired behaviors. This topic goes along with most of the topics in this section. A lot of your success in college depends on <em>you</em> and how much energy you choose to put into the things you do. </li>
	<li> <strong>Industry &amp; Academia is splintered (unless you go to a University with a co-op program)</strong>: I could make this point into an entire chapter of this document. This topic is incredible in the modern era, and it deserves a lot more attention in this document later on. I talk about this more in the section “before college” that chronicles my journey to being a student at Rochester. For the sake of brevity, I will only talk about this shortly in this section, and you can pick up on my thoughts for this topic later. The <em>main idea</em> that I wanted to get across in this point is the divide between academia and industry. At my school specifically, you are either on a path to industry or a path to academia. By the time you’re a junior, you will have already made a decision about which path to take. <em>Due to the requirements to graduate school, it is very difficult to balance both industry experience and research experience simultaneously. </em> You will not only find this divide in your job or graduate school choices, but also in the motivations of your professors. Of course, if you go to a university with a lot of professors from industry, you will avoid most of what I am about to say. You can also find “revolving door” professors who balance their time between industry and academia. Usually, these professors put their eggs in both baskets and are therefore not an expert at either of these pursuits. On the right-most side of the spectrum, you get career academics, which make up the majority of the professors in my CS program. <em>These professors are some of the most talented people on the planet. </em> They have likely jumped through every hoop thrown at them, and they are an expert in their sub-field. The problem with career academic professors is two-fold. First, they place much more emphasis on theoretical knowledge. What works for me, what works for the industry, and what works for the professor are very different things. Second, due to the relatively faced-paced nature of the industry, it is difficult for most career academic professors to teach applied material. Of course, a lot of the material you learn in these types of more theoretical classes will be important to your job, but most of the attention is paid to the theoretical knowledge, and not what actually works on the job. Perhaps it is the nature of my CS program, being less job focused than an “institute of technology” school, but the disconnection between the work done in industry vs. academia is a huge issue for me, since I side with applied material. Perhaps again, this is just a personal pet-peeve of mine with industry in academia. Perhaps if my CS program was more job-oriented, I would not notice this divide. However, it has become overwhelmingly apparent that a lot of the content I have learned in CS classes does not help me on the job. You will likely find more applied material if you are in an “applied” program, supplemented with co-op jobs experiences and internships. I have good friends at more “technical” schools who would not find any problems like this, and I get that. However, this point is more specific to my school and what I have experienced at a non-technical-majority university. </li>
	<li> <strong>You are doing okay</strong>: One of the biggest challenges for me in college was overcoming the notion that I was somehow inferior to my classmates. When you enter a high-level math class for the first time, the intelligence of your classmates can be daunting at first. If you have made it all the way to a four-year program in CS, you have made a lot of the right decisions along the way. A lot of people will try to convince you that you are not smart, that you will add nothing to the field, or you are <em>“not good enough for Google”</em>. For the most part, you can ignore this sentiment. What matters that most is that you have the <em>tenacity</em> for the behavior you choose to engage in. You feel many times in college that you are inferior or not capable, but if you can recognize that this is likely false (everyone generally has the same capacity), you can go on to output great work. </li>
	<li><strong>You have access to top professors</strong>: This goes along with the points I made earlier about the divide between industry and academia. One of the hallmarks of universities in the U.S. is that they are sponges for top minds. If you’ve worked all the way up in the field, and dedicated your life to a sub-field, academia is the best place. Academia frees people to focus on questions, ideas, and topics without having to worry about the “bottom-line” that they might experience at a company. With this, the professors at your school will likely be the most talented people on the planet in their chosen sub-field. <em>I might add that you should take advantage of this. </em> If you see yourself graduating an undergraduate CS program and looking to go into a specific sub-field, reach out to the professors you find interesting. There are likely very few people as close to you with the breadth of knowledge they have about that sub-field. A quick criticism to this point is that professors are busy people and do not have time to talk to undergrads deeply. This may be the case at some places; however, I think conversations with these professors could prove invaluable to research opportunities for graduate school. Talk to your professors! If you have a common interest, engage that, and something might come out of it. </li>
	<li><strong><em>It’s important to do things that are interesting to you; things that are interesting to you uniquely</em> </strong>: As a high school senior about to enter college, this might seem logical. You can easily underestimate the value of doing things that are only interesting to you. That’s the way you can cultivate what <strong><em>you</em></strong> bring to the table. In a world of 7 billion, you need to bring unique things to the table. The only way to bring unique things to the table is to find things that are uniquely interesting to you. Perhaps the implementation of this idea is too theoretical, but I wish I could give a more concrete example. </li>
</ol>

<p>In preparation for the rest of this document, I want to share two writings that have helped me decide what to do in college. The first important writing was due by Marc Andreessen and original published on his blog. It’s called the “Pmarca Guide to Career Planning” and I have inserted an excepted below. </p>

<p>His first piece of advice is difficult for new university students at 18 years old to comprehend. 18 year olds are not thinking about their career but they will quickly realize that thinking past college will be important. Marc goes on to write:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The first rule of career planning: Do not plan your career.</strong> The world is an incredibly complex place and everything is changing all the time. You can&#39;t plan your career because you have no idea what&#39;s going to happen in the future. You have no idea what industries you&#39;ll enter, what companies you&#39;ll work for, what roles you&#39;ll have, where you&#39;ll live, or what you will ultimately contribute to the world. You&#39;ll change, industries will change, the world will change, and you can&#39;t possibly predict any of it.</p>

<p>Trying to plan your career is an exercise in futility that will only serve to frustrate you, and to blind you to the really significant opportunities that life will throw your way.</p>

<p>Career planning = career limiting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a student who planned on a career in Physics in high school, I particularly like this advice. It speaks to the flexibility that you have to have in career planning. Especially in college, unless you’re going to be a doctor, it does not serve a great purpose to constrain your career potential. Of course you can define a direction, but since things change so rapidly, don’t plan your career more than a few years into the future. </p>

<p>The next piece of advice involves being “alert to opportunities” which he discusses here at length. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second rule of career planning: Instead of planning your career, focus on developing skills and pursuing opportunities.</p>

<p>Opportunities are key. I would argue that opportunities fall loosely into two buckets: those that present themselves to you, and those that you go out and create. Both will be hugely important to your career.</p>

<p>Opportunities that present themselves to you are the consequence -- at least partially -- of being in the right place at the right time. They tend to present themselves when you&#39;re not expecting it -- and often when you are engaged in other activities that would seem to preclude you from pursuing them. And they come and go quickly -- if you don&#39;t jump all over an opportunity, someone else generally will and it will vanish.</p>

<p>I believe a huge part of what people would like to refer to as &quot;career planning&quot; is being continuously alert to opportunities that present themselves to you spontaneously, when you happen to be in the right place at the right time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, this next section is probably the best section of Marc Andreessen’s article. It speaks specifically to advice within a technical undergraduate degree, which is the focus of this book. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What should I study in college?</strong></p>

<p>Some people argue that college will be your one chance in life to pursue your passion -- to spend four years doing nothing but studying whatever you love the most, whether that&#39;s Renaissance literature or existential philosophy. </p>

<p>I disagree.</p>

<p>If you intend to have an impact on the world, the faster you start developing concrete skills that will be useful in the real world, the better -- and your undergrad degree is a great place to start. Once you get into the real world and you&#39;re primed for success, then you can pursue your passion.</p>

<p>A typical liberal arts degree will be almost useless on its own. So you usually won&#39;t have the option of immediately entering the workforce in a high-impact way when you graduate, and you&#39;ll have to go get a useful graduate degree.</p>

<p>And even if you are already planning to get a useful graduate degree, you are much better off combining it with a substantive undergraduate degree -- thereby becoming a &quot;double threat&quot;. More on this in a bit.</p>

<p><strong>Which undergraduate degrees are useful in the real world?</strong></p>

<p>Typically, those that have a technical element of some form -- that teach you how to do something substantive.</p>

<p>Engineering degrees obviously qualify. The current myth that engineering and computer science degrees are less useful because all the jobs are going to India and China is silliness; ignore it.</p>

<p>Hard science degrees -- physics, chemistry -- also clearly qualify, as do mathematics and economics.</p>

<p><strong>Why do I take this stance?</strong></p>

<p>Technical degrees teach you how to do something difficult and useful that matters in the real world. Even if you don&#39;t end up actually doing what the degree teaches you how to do, going through the experience of learning how to do it will help you go through other serious learning experiences in your career. Complexity and difficulty will not faze you.</p>

<p>Plus, technical degrees teach you how think like an engineer, a scientist, an economist, or a mathematician -- how to use reason, logic, and data. This is incredibly useful in the real world, which generally demands rigorous thinking on the path to doing anything big.</p>

<p>Plus, technical degrees indicate seriousness of purpose to future employers and partners. You get coded right up front as someone who is intent on doing real things.</p>

<p>Graduating with a technical degree is like heading out into the real world armed with an assault rifle instead of a dull knife. Don&#39;t miss that opportunity because of some fuzzy romanticized view of liberal arts broadening your horizons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a lot of info, but you can come back to it later. I have found this advice to be particularly important for my undergraduate CS education. You can read the full, seven section blog post here: <a href="http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part0.html">http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part0.html</a></p>

<h2>How is this organized?</h2>

<p>Each chapter has two themes that intertwine but are distinctly different. You may read these chapter as one item, “Gentle Anxiety; How Can I Get There”. However, the semi-colon is important. They represent two distinct titles. You will notice that the second theme for each of the four section is a question. This question is loosely related to the first theme of each section; each serves its own purpose though. Do not be tempted to thing the two titles are saying the same thing. Each chapter name represents sort of a poetic theme throughout the book. Each year was something different; I felt different each year. Therefore, each chapter explores a different question I was asking that year. At the end of the year, it’s likely that I answered the question proposed in the title. You can read each year and then see if I actually reached an answer to the question *smiles*. </p>

<p>Many things in this document will be personal; however; the main focus will be on things that the reader (you) can benefit from. I don’t say names of anyone in the stories.</p>

<h1>Before College</h1>

<h2>Seeking a College</h2>

<p>In high school, I was the person in the corner of the bookstore reading “the big college book” with all of the descriptions of each college and their admissions statistics. The mentality I had during high school, which lead me to the set of colleges I applied to was: What’s the best place I can get in? At the time, I felt that this was the best philosophy. In my competitive high school, which greatly valued the name of your college, a top school “name” was the target for many kids. Of course, I fell into this. Therefore, the last thing I considered in college decisions was a social environment. At the time, I cared about two things: How good is the CS program; Can I get in? </p>

<p>Did I choose the wrong college? Probably not. However, it would have been easy to do so. In a selection process that only values a few items, it is easy to miss items that actually make college life bearable (i.e. friends, entertainment, escapes from campus). The process from applying to colleges, to getting in, to accepting happens in a flash. You will find yourself making decisions very quickly, likely by factor of elimination (rejection). </p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Go to a college with things nearby</strong>: As I will say many times in this section, most of college is not spent in class. You will spend a large majority of your time being bored, unless there are things to do outside of class. When looking at colleges, look at what activities exist on and off campus that could be interesting. How many parks are nearby? What’s the weather like? Can I ride my bike places? Are there sports teams I could join? What movie theaters are around? Is there access to nature? You will depend on the non-class activities for most of your time during college. Choose a college with a good amount (not too many) outside activities to keep you busy when you have down time. That being said, try not to choose a college with <em>too</em> many things nearby. For example, New York University is right in the center of young-hip bars, restaurants, and activities. When you actually need to get work done, will you be distracted by the things around your college? If you will be, I suggest finding a college with the right balance of in-class and out-of-class activities. On that note, I would shy away from colleges in rural areas. Rural areas increase the likelihood of isolation to non-school activities and outside-of-school programs. Rural areas also cause problems for the next few points I will make, which involve reasons to go to a college with other top schools nearby for things like hack-a-thons, meet-ups, and events at those schools. For example, my college is right next to another top engineering school, Rochester Institute of Technology, which I have been to several times for hack-a-thons and talks by important people. </li>
	<li><strong>When looking at CS programs, look at alumni</strong>: I cannot tell you how many alumni friends I have made from UofR’s CS department who have gone on to do successful things post-graduation. If you want to see the success or failure of a college CS program, check to see where most alumni end up. Alumni success in graduate school or in the job market is a great indicator of the quality of a program. My junior year, I met an alumnus from my school named Tyler, who graduated several years before me, and was a software engineer at Facebook and Instagram. This was a person I could look up to, and we are now good friends because of our connection to the same university. Have you considered reaching out to alumni? Do you have friends or family who are alumni of the schools you apply to? What types of jobs do they have? Did they enjoy their time at that school? You can learn a lot by talking to alumni, and even more if those alumni do the types of things that you want to do in the future too. </li>
	<li><strong>Should I go into debt to go to a top school?</strong>: Most top schools are unaffordable for most people. If this is the case, seek merit and financial aid. If you are a top student, there is a good chance you can reduce a lot of potential debt. Entering debt to go to a top school is a lukewarm subject for me. This topic should be taken on a case-by-case basis. However, I will say a couple of things. Should you be borrowing money to make an investment in college? Debt with a high, likely guarantee-able return-on-investment (ROI) is not detrimental. This is conditional on your performance in school and on the job after you graduate. You should do your best to minimize debt when paying for college; however, with a degree and job in Computer Science after you graduate, the ROI of that degree will improve you earning potential for the rest of your life. Debt is a bad thing to get into, but the ROI on a CS degree is very high (and almost guaranteed) if you can work hard enough to gain the talents needed to get a job. In this sense, debt is <em>okay</em>, as long as you are committed to putting in the work to have that ROI after you graduate. The state of college financials in 2017 is less than desirable. If you have the capacity to borrow some money, work a job during college, and can work towards the degree, it is almost certain that you can pay the debt off after you graduate with a job, but be careful. </li>
	<li><strong>Go to a college with other colleges nearby (driving distance)</strong>: This is important for not only meeting other students (from other colleges), but going to the events at other colleges. My freshman year, the founder of Reddit.com came to Rochester Institute of Technology, which is right near my college. I was able to go to that event, and I even spoke at it! You will find it a lot easier to go to events like this, including hack-a-thons, if you can drive to universities in the area. If you go to college at a place that is not near any other college, you will not be able to travel to other schools. Being close to a big city also helps. Often in big cities, there are meet-ups for people interested in certain technologies, coding languages, or research. You can only take advantage of these things if your college is near (within driving distance) or a big city. Keep this in mind when you are considering the geographic location of the schools you apply to.</li>
	<li><strong>Unless you go to an ivy-league name college, name recognition doesn’t help much</strong>: Specifically for Software Engineering jobs in technology, choosing between schools for name recognition is not a helpful exercise. Through all of my interviews and internships, very few people recognize my university (University of Rochester), even though it is the Top #33 Private Universities in the U.S. The one <em>bar none</em> exception to this advice is graduate school. To my knowledge, name recognition, even if it is not an ivy-league, can do a lot to further your graduate school prospects. Anyways, for applied jobs without graduate school, my college’s name does not “raise eyebrows” substantially, unless that person knows someone who have graduated from the CS program. Only schools with recognized, widely known CS programs, will raise eyebrows. There are notable exceptions to the name-recognition rule like Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, UCLA, NYU, or other non-ivy schools with top CS programs. These <em>do</em> provide valuable name recognition to future employers. However, do not expect a school’s name to carry weight unless it is a top-tier school in the sub-discipline. These names are not Ivy League, but their name is well recognized on job application. Hiring managers <em>do</em> know where good kids come from, but beyond a certain level, it does not benefit you to worry about name-recognition. <strong><em>When evaluating a college, go into it with a level-head. Look at the strength of its CS program, its alumni, its faculty and whether you would be a good fit. </em></strong></li>
	<li><strong>If you like the idea of co-ops, choose a college that offers them</strong>: With my intense personal focus on jobs and internships, I do wish I went to a college with a co-op program so that I could graduate in 5 years. Since I do not have plans to go to graduate school, job experience is key for me. Without a co-op program or the culture &amp; resources to seek jobs during school, I am not as well-off as some of my friends who have worked for top companies while still getting their degree. This is a great way to pay for college and gain valuable experience. If you know that you are not going to go to graduate school, definitely focus on schools with a good co-op program. Ask about this during your on-campus visits. Even if you do not plan on doing a co-op, it is at least good to have that option availible, if you do choose to seek it out. For instance, my university does not have a co-op program. I would never have that options. For some friends, I have seen a complex negotiation process for co-ops, since there is no infrastructure in place. For these kids, that still choose a co-op path without a university program, you can expect to jump through a lot more hoops. </li>
	<li><strong>Again, non-school lifestyle is a key to think about when choosing a college</strong>: You are living at this place 24/7. This means that out-of-class time will be some of the most important things to think about. What will you do on weekends? What restaurants will you eat dinner at? Where will you go during spring break? What groceries stores are around? Are there major cities nearby to go to concerts and events?</li>
	<li><strong>Degree choice</strong>: Worried about getting buckled into a degree you’re not interested in? This can happen very easily. Often, students get into college by applying to a specific program or college within the university. They are then on a 4 year path to that degree. Unless you are very smart and can switch programs, what happens 18-months into the program when you realize that Electrical Engineering is not your passion, and you want to do Computer Science instead. What happens if those two majors are across entire disciplines? <strong><em>Consider degree flexibility when looking at CS programs</em></strong> Do you have other interests outside of CS? Will you be able to engage in those interests in college? Does your degree program allow you to take classes outside of CS? I was lucky in that my school has an “open curriculum” which means that there are <em>no required class for the major</em>. I have a lot of flexibility when it comes to coursework. This is partially why I was able to double-major in Psychology with Computer Science. However, my second choice when applying to colleges <em>was</em> a college with extremely limited movement once I got accepted. In high school, I was very passionate about science and physics, and I was not sure that Computer Science was the right path for me. If I did choose a school that forced me to study the field I was accepted into, I would likely have a poor experience. <strong><em>When applying to colleges, take degree flexibility into consideration. </em></strong> Not everyone knows what they want to do when they get to college, but some do, <strong><em>having some flexibility to leave your major allows you to move around if you’re headed towards a degree that is not your passion. </em></strong> However, there is a double-edged sword to open curriculums that I have experienced here at Rochester. With advising, there is often no inherent enforcement of structure to programs. There is too much freedom is dropping courses that you should actually take. For example, my sophomore year when I was considering taking more Psychology course, I was completely free to drop every single one of my CS courses in the registrar, without any enforcement until I declared the major. in fact, I did not even declare both of my majors until fall Junior year. I had a ton of flexibility to take other classes. Only when I declared the major did I have to worry about fulfilling requirements, which are not really enforced. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Why Care about the Social Environment?</h2>

<p><strong>For me, the biggest surprise about college was how I neglected to the social environment when evaluating a college. </strong>Your goals should be to find a college that matches your goals for a social life in college. It is one of the most important aspects, since like I said before, you will spend your entire life at this single place for 4 years. It is therefore imperative that you have access to choices when it comes to social environments on a college campus. You needs and goals with a social environment will vary over time, like they did for me. At first, I thought that the only goal to college was getting a 4.0 GPA and studying a lot (like I tried to do in high school). I then realized that college is a much more social environment than I every realized in high school. The same rules about a social environment in high school did not apply to college. </p>

<p>Let me dive into this a little bit deeper. In college, your social environment serves to lift you up and support you. In high school, a social environment is similar, but it’s not as impactful as you will experience in college. In a college environment, the only people you interact with are +/- 3 years of age from you. This means that you do not get the normal social exposure to people of different ages. When you go out into the real world, there are people of all different ages; however in college, it’s hard to find people in the middle area between “being a professor’s age” and “being a student’s age”. For this reason, you begin to depend on your social environment a lot in college. Having a good social environment is paramount because you can find yourself lost, dazed, and confused when you spend multiple weekends in your dorm room alone. Balance your social life in college, loneliness and isolation can creep up very quickly. </p>

<p>In any new environment, you are bound to have to make “new friends” and find the places where you fit in the social hierarchy. However, this socialization process in college is probably unlike what you have gone through before. You will likely have to juggle between several “friend spheres” which overlap. For instance, I have Computer Science friends, fraternity friends, and sports friends. Some people in one or two spheres overlaps, and I they have mutual friends in both groups. You will likely not just have a single friend sphere in college. Naturally due to the complex environment, you will dedicate more time to one friend sphere than another. </p>

<p>Facing loneliness and isolation in college was a huge deal for me. If you are not naturally extroverted, building this social core can be difficult in college, since it is such a big place. The normal advice like “try things out” typically does not work well when organically forming friend groups. <strong><em>I would take a “leave the door open” approach to forming this social core.</em></strong> You might find something that you did not expect to like. Be open. It may form the basis of this social core when you did not expect it to when entering the college program. </p>

<h1>Year One: Blossoming; What is This?</h1>

<p>I applied to around eight colleges in high school. I got accepted into two. This may seem surprising; I had good grades, good extracurriculars, and good test score. However, what you learn when applying to colleges is that even with the best grades you&#39;re not guaranteed a spot. I think what have we weighed in to my acceptances was the likelihood of attending that school. So for the schools that I did not get into, it is likely that they suspected I would not attend. </p>

<p>My first acceptance was Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy New York. It was the university that my uncle attended, and I was very familiar with it. My second acceptance was at the University of Rochester. I did not get into the eight other schools I applied to.</p>

<p>During high school, I had my eyes set on a school like Carnegie Mellon University. I wanted to go to school with a good reputation in technology – a school that would look impressive on a résumé. With Carnegie Mellon as my model, I applied to schools with similar attributes - near a big city, a post industrial town, far away from my home but still within driving distance. I spent a lot of time during high school figuring out how I could get into you the best school given my grades and academics. I had a lot of expectations leading up to college, what I did not have any expectations for once I got to college.</p>

<p>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was a typical acceptance. I got an email, I was excited, and I was glad that I got into at least one of the schools I applied to. <strong>University of Rochester was a different case.</strong> They do not send acceptances via email; they only send acceptances through the mail. For one to three weeks, I was waiting every day for some sort of letter to come in the mail. At the end of the three weeks, a letter never came. I knew that if I got denied, I would have received a letter. I knew if I got excepted I would have received a letter. I was baffled at why I had not received some sort of correspondence in the mail. Each of the final days of that week, I remember driving up the road to my house, wondering if the latter would be in the mail that day.</p>

<p>The letter never came.</p>

<p>One day in English class, just after lunch, I received a message from my father on my phone. Of course, near the end of the semester, my high school teachers were comfortable with us using our iPhones during class. So of course, I peaked at my phone all day waiting for any sort of message or update. My father had emailed the school wondering if a letter would be in the now. They said they would send a new letter in the mail hearing however, my father then told me that they would send an email with the acceptance decision within 20 minutes. So on my phone, here in English class, the decision about going to college was going to be made for me. I knew that if I was accepted to Rochester, I would go because it was the best of my options. If I got rejected from Rochester, I knew I would go to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In my mind, the decision was already made up to where I would attend based on my septum to Rochester or not.</p>

<p>I nervously opened up my phone. I started reading the email, and the first words of the email were not the typical &quot;congratulations on your acceptance.&quot; The letter went on to discuss how I was excepted, but I would have to wait a semester and come in January as a spring semester student.</p>

<p>To understand the position I was in, I would like to go back to the accepted students day at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. During high school and most of my development, I always had a very negative association with people that you would consider as quote-on-quote “nerds”. Of course, I was one of them. I liked electronics, I did student government, and I was very academic. However, something about going to a college where the sports team was named&quot; the engineers&quot;, did not settle well with me at the time. I wanted to go to a college that had a bit more diversity of majors. During the accepted students day, I was taken aback by the grand scale of the school. Every excepted student had come that day, whereas Rochester split it up into four separate weekends. I did not get a good impression of RPI that day for whatever reason. It may have been the size, the interactions with the coordinators, or is the weather. Around that same weekend, or maybe the next weekend, we have the accepted students day at Rochester. Nearly opposite, was a the weather was good that day, student seem to study a diverse range of topics, And their sports team was not named &quot;the engineers.” </p>

<p>I was not completely sold on Rochester either. Of course the ideal in my head of Carnegie Mellon cast a shadow on my viewpoints regarding Rochester. Even though I could not attend Carnegie Mellon, the spirit of wanting to go to the school stuck with me.</p>

<p>So here I was. In my fifth period English class ready to receive an email on my phone. As I was reading the letter, it at first did not make any sense. Why would I go to a school in January. Why am I not accepted with the rest of the students? </p>

<h2>First-Semester, Staying at Home</h2>

<p>Because of my January acceptance at Rochester, I decided to take classes at the university on the same campus as my high school – Fairfield University. I would have a light workload during this period – two classes in things that would be useful to me at Rochester. I made sure the credits would transfer, and I registered for the courses just after I formally graduated high school. I was familiar with the university and its people, so I did not expect any surprises. The whole campus was founded by the Jesuits, a subset of Catholics that were academic in nature and very open-minded. In high school, I absorbed a lot of their philosophies about a “God in all things” and being a man for others. </p>

<h3>Fairfield University</h3>

<p>I was at Fairfield for a semester from September to December during my transition to the January acceptance at Rochester. Fairfield was on the same campus as my high school, which made the familiarity amazing. This six month period was great for me. I made tons of connections and worked on some great side projects. I also applied to the fellowship I would do later that next year in New York City. During this period, I took two classes for the transition –– Economics and Calculus. </p>

<h4>Taking Calculus at Fairfield</h4>

<p>Calculus was arguably great. It was nothing like the classes I would take six months later at Rochester. At Fairfield, the professor had us complete the lecture at home ready to come to class and complete exercises. His philosophy was one of a reverse-classroom. And as a self-taught learner, it was a great environment to study Calculus. If I was doing poorly in the class, I easily would know why. All you need to do is rewatch the lecture and practice the concept more in class. I was given a great professor. He singled me out as being a non-Fairfield student, which made me feel very special in the class. </p>

<p><br/>At the beginning of the semester, he had every student write their name, bio, and a fact about them on a notecard. In the beginning, he would sit in front of the class and read every notecard aloud. It made me feel like a special and valued member of the class. In his eyes, I was able to work hard in recognition that he could also see me during class. Since I was relatively eager during this period, I could also answer questions aloud in class, something I would never do at Rochester. I felt comfortable answering and asking questions which made the learning process that much greater. </p>

<p>He made the subject approachable and achievable. It was the only math class in “college” where I succeeded. I am very grateful for this professor’s work during my time at Fairfield. </p>

<h4>Taking Micro-Economics at Fairfield</h4>

<p>The other class in this period was micro-economics, and I was exposed to a great deal. Although the subject of the class was rudimentary, I had never taken an economics class before. It exposed me to a new way of thinking about the world, and to this day, I still use concepts I learn in the class. Economics made me think differently about everything in my life. <em>How do we think about return-on-investment? What created the conditions for dead weight loss? What motivates firms and consumers? Are firms and consumers irrational or rational?</em> The class was small but I always sat in the front. </p>

<h4>A Note</h4>

<p>Before my semester at Fairfield, I was quite prejudice towards students at non-top tier colleges like community colleges. I had always assumed that students at top colleges work the hardest, were the most passionate, and had the best skills. Seeing all the bright students in both of these classes at Fairfield definitely changed my perspective. The fact is: there are talented and motivated individuals at every level. Just because they don’t go to Rochester or Brown or Stanford does not mean they are untalented. I was sort of raised in this line of thinking — especially at my high school. In my mind, I developed a prejudice that students at these lower-tier schools “must be less intelligent for having lower grades”. In reality, there’s a dozen circumstances as to why they would be there. I am deeply regretful for having this type of thinking.</p>

<h2>A Reflection on My High School Environment</h2>

<p>To help explain some of my early feelings at Fairfield, it might be beneficial to discuss where I was coming from. </p>

<h3>Social </h3>

<p>My high school was all-male. There were no girls and no social environment unless you were “a social person.” I bring it up at this point because on my first day at Fairfield, I had an interesting experience. For four years, there were no girls in my classes. On the first day at Fairfield, it was now a good fifty-fifty split between boys and girls. I remember turning around to greet the person behind me during the first class introductions. I was stunned at how beautiful this girl was. <em>”How can someone be that pretty,”</em> I thought to myself, having not been around girls my age for four years. </p>

<p>The social environment for me in high school revoked around my robotics club, my science fair friends, the people I rode the bus with, and my cross-country friends. Since my high school was 30 minutes from my house, there was no way I would hang out with friends after I left school grounds. For a 13-17 year old, this environment was idyllic. I was about to focus on my science fair work (a huge part of my life at this point), my sports, and my grade. I was extremely well-rounded, and my health &amp; wellness saw the benefits.</p>

<p>All of this early work was in preparation for getting into a good college. </p>

<h2>Surgery in December</h2>

<p>While all this was happening I was dealing with a running injury that affected me a lot psychologically. As a cross country runner in high school, I ran between five and eight miles per day. With a thin physique like my own, I developed a condition known as a spontaneous pneumothorax. This was an abrasion in the lung that caused shortness of breath, shoulder pain, and a general sense of unease. Unlike a broken bone or a cut, I could not tell when this problem was affecting me. After several of these episodes happened, I decided in that October to get surgery in December right before I would go to school at Rochester. </p>

<p>This surgery was not foolproof, it could solve my issue by strengthening the lung wall on my left side. It was a tough decision because the procedure’s recovery would take 3 days. I had never had surgery before, and this surgery would involve being knocked out, having a camera inserted into my ribs, and having a tube sticking out of my body. Knowing how much this condition was affecting me, I felt it was the right decision to go through with that. After I finished the semester at Fairfield, I had the surgery during my Christmas break. While under anesthesia for around an hour, my chest was cut open, my lung was corrected, and a tube was placed in my chest. I spent New Years Eve and New Year&#39;s day in the hospital. During the dropping of the ball in New York City I was in my bed taking Percocet. This may be an over-dramatization of the pain of this event, it was a relatively straightforward and simple procedure. Three days later, the tube was removed from my chest, the stitches were placed in, and I went home. </p>

<p>Overall, I think that event impacted me a lot. It taught me that I was not invincible. For some reason, I considered this event like a “paying of debts” of sorts. I felt that I had done so well in my life, that now I had to pay for it – like a transaction with the universe. God had given me all of these successes, and therefore I had to suffer to repay him. <strong>It’s how I felt, but I now know that God doesn’t choose your fate – you, your doctors, modern medicine, and your lifestyle do.</strong></p>

<p>It also taught me a lot about healthcare. I had such privilege here. My parents and insurance took care of most things, my doctor was one of the best surgeons, and the hospital was one of the best in the area. <strong>For him, this was a 45 minute procedure; for me, it was a huge inflection point that completely changed my life. </strong>It’s quite something how life works out –&nbsp;how something can mean so little to one person and so much to another. </p>

<p>You can imagine how I felt on January 3rd of 2014 when I left the hospital. In 2 weeks, I was going to begin — what was supposed to be — the start of the best 4 years of my life and a college career. I had spent three years in high school planning for college, and now, with a late acceptance in January, I had been crippled at the start. </p>

<h2>Mental Health</h2>

<p><em>Quick note: This is going to be a recurring theme, so you may get used to seeing this subtitle.</em></p>

<p>After this surgery I started at Rochester around two weeks later. The stitches had been taken out and the wound mostly closed. I was still 135 pounds and psychologically fragile. I watched everywhere I went. If I had to pick up a box, I worried about it. If I had to move anything over 5 pounds, I worried about it. I remember one of my great successes that previous fall was being able to ride a bike without worrying about my chest collapsing on itself. I was so timid. I watched my body 24/7. </p>

<p>Driving up to Rochester for the January start was a strange experience. <strong>Starting freshman year in January is like coming to the party you weren’t invited to.</strong> Everyone else got the “invitation” six months earlier, and I was late to the party. My orientation was unusual. Because only 100 students started in January, I struggled to make any friends with my freshman class during that period. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. I assumed I wouldn’t like it so I didn’t engage with others, then surprisingly I wondered why I didn’t like the environment. The combination of my surgery recovery and introversion made those first few months difficult. And it was all my fault.</p>

<p>We never discussed post-surgery mental health or my mental health during the transition to college. I had assumed all my feelings were normal, and that I had to “deal with them“ because I was a boy and boys don’t express feelings. I internalized everything and never really talked to anyone. Of course, my surgery experience changed my experience in those first few weeks at college. I wanted to stay in my room to recover and not stress my body to much. This means that I barely made any friends. For this excuse, I stayed in my room always. </p>

<p>I had every expectation for college for the events leading to an acceptance letter. However, I had no expectation for what life would actually be like when I got there. High school was a very familiar place to me. I had gone through a challenging transition from middle school, so I had assumed that nothing could be worse. <strong>I flourished in high school. It was an amazing place for my personal growth.</strong> It was all male, around 900 students, and I was able to define my own personality during the four years there. </p>

<p><strong>Truly, college was the first time I had been away from home for months at a time.</strong> It was the first time I was living on my own. It was the largest environment of young people I ever had to live in. </p>

<h2>The Spring</h2>

<p>My first roommate at college was a very intelligent mechanical engineer major who was on the football team. He was not the ideal roommate and clashed a lot with my personality. Most times, I think I was trying to be polite and courteous when he was around. I was athletic, but I was not a football player. At the time, I was not ready to make good friends with a college football player. My own biases and perceptions influences my interactions. You don’t have to like your first roommate, but you should do your best to build bridges. In the start, that’s what I did. I built some bridges when he was around and was able to become friends with a few people on my hall. You have to realize that this is the 2014 version of Kyle. This is not the present day Kyle. Back then, I was very introverted and really did not like most people. With the introduction to my first roommate, who I won’t name, I did everything to make the experience reasonable for both of us. </p>

<p>Because I was a January student, I was paired with this roommate for that reason. At first, I was paired with a student in a double room on the quad. Receiving that message on my computer at home, I was very excited. I though something along the lines of, “<em>I’m excited about having this roommate.</em>” Most of it made sense and it was the first tangible reality of college. I ended up messaging him on Facebook. After a 5 minute conversation, something along these lines happened:</p>

<p><em>“<strong>Him:</strong> That’s strange that you would be my roommate. My previous roommate hasn’t moved his things. I am not sure when he is planning to move out.”</em></p>

<p>This had been a mistake by housing. That student was slotted to move but actually wasn’t going to. I contacted the school about the problem. Their solution was to place in the basement of a freshman dorm. It was a double, but I was the only person assigned there. I typed back in confusion and frustration. Around a week later, they replied that they had found <em>another</em> room for me, with a roommate, in the freshman dorm. <strong>Not a great first introduction to college.</strong></p>

<p>Of all the rooms, this one was an empty slot for me. I was paired in a double room with a football player. His previous roommate was also on the football team. <strong>He either got kicked out of school or left due to drug and alcohol problem. I thought it was reasonable.</strong> My roommate had described some strange stories about the previous roommate. He described his behavior and it was abundantly clear that there was a good reason he left the school.</p>

<p>My roommate that spring was a very kind person to me, but by the middle of the semester he became quite polarizing.<strong> After March, I mostly had the room to myself. </strong>He began a relationship with the girl across the hall, and you can use your imagination from there. When his parents came at one point in the semester, he suggested I help make our room “look like he lived there” which was false. Many of his day-to-day items had moved to her room.</p>

<h2>More Mental Health</h2>

<p>Looking back, starting in January was probably one of the greatest inflection points. I did not internalize the effect that a January start date freshman year would have on the rest of my college experience. <strong>It was detrimental.</strong> When I entered Rochester that spring, I entered a residence hall where everyone was already friends. As a natural introvert, I had no motivation to meet new people or go out to parties. I did not know how to engaged in environment that was very different from my high school. I was now living 24/7 at this place. I cannot go home, I did not have a car, and there were not many things to do. With this reality I desired to stay in my room, do my work, and be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>No one ever tells you how it&#39;s going to be in college. It is not like high school where you wake up, have a defined school day, come home, play some sports, and then go to bed. At college, your time is up to your discretion. You choose when you want to do things, who you see, and when you want to do your work. Nothing is defined. You are completely free to not go to class, stay indoors, or not talk to anyone if you don&#39;t want to.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was naïve when I first got to college. <strong>But for the first time, no one was telling me where to go. </strong>Without the training on how to behave in this environment, I did what felt natural. I woke up, went to class, worked on my computer, slept, and did everything over again the next day. I did not leave my room because no one required me to. I did not go to parties because no one required me too. In high school, you were required to do a lot of different things. There was a defined schedule, there was a defined way of doing things, and most of the day made sense. <strong>College did not make much sense.</strong></p>

<p>I had assumed all my feelings were normal, and that I had to “deal with them“ because I was a boy and boys don’t express feelings. I internalized everything and never really talked to anyone. I <em>did</em> make a few friends that spring. However by that fall, the top three of my friends either transferred or studied abroad. “Appropriate,” I thought, which pushed my self-fulfilling state towards more depression. </p>

<p>My first classes didn’t go well either. I did very reasonable with grades in high school, but that did not matter. That spring, I took Calculus, Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Writing. Overall, I had nothing to complain about my classes. They were interesting and worthwhile now that I look back. Half way through the semester, I dropped out of my calculus class in favor of an easier version. I think I got a 50% on the first exam, and I was still able to switch to the lower level in March. </p>

<p>I was not prepared for how these students made me feel. They were smart – <em>really smart</em>. I felt everyone was smarter than me. “I suck at this” was a common phrase I said under my breath at the end of an exam. I was not confident in myself or my abilities. It was a stark difference from present day as I write this. Most of the time, students and teachers made me feel incapable, worthless, and not valued as a student. Perhaps it was the size of the classes, but I went to feeling valued in high school to feeling like I didn’t need to be a student there. I didn’t feel valued, and I didn’t feel like a member of the community. <strong>All of this fed the fuel for me to hate my school, which of course, was all in my head.</strong> I dug the rabbit hole, and every new experience became a reason to fill up that fuel.</p>

<h2>My April Birthday</h2>

<p><strong>For the first time, I was dealing with depression, and I couldn’t name what the problem was. </strong>Like I said, I assumed my condition was normal. However, it was not. I dreaded many things during the day. I did not want to blame myself for how I felt. It was all about blaming other things – the school, my dorm, or my circumstances (a false premise that I will cover in a different section). That spring in April, I was able to FaceTime my parents and virtually have a birthday celebration. The event, which I would later describe to a therapist later that August, allowed for the recognition that I couldn’t express depression or know what it was. It was about all those hours in high school spent to get here, all those college books that I read, all of those college applications, and all of those hours my parents put into finding the right place. <strong>All of that hard work for this – a place where I felt terrible all the time. </strong>On top of that, my parents were paying $30,000 for the spring semester. How could I express my state for my parents? I couldn’t. We had worked so hard for me to say that I hated college life. <strong>We had invested so much; there was no way I could say I was not enjoying it. </strong></p>

<p>It took an outside observer, a therapist, later that August when I was living in New York City for the summer, to help me get those feelings out. It was finally okay to express that I didn’t like college. </p>

<h2>Good in a Bad Way</h2>

<p>You could say that this period inspired my work in psychology. In an effort to understand myself, I became interested in the subject. Three years later, I would have a double-major degree with psychology. I am very thankful for this. My work in psychology has expanded my horizons, changed who I am, and gave me a new way to reason about the world I live in. More on this later.</p>

<h2>Fork in the Road with Natural Science or Computer Science during High School</h2>

<p>We are now mid-semester into my first semester at Rochester in 2014. To help explain what’s about to happen, I want to go back to high school and explain some decisions I made about college. </p>

<p>For all of high school and middle school, I did science fairs. I was really good at them, and I won a bunch of awards each year. I was also the leader of the FTC robotics team at my high school; I was one of the people who helped start it. I was fascinated by renewable energy. Before junior year of high school, I think I pictured myself majoring in Physics or Mechanical Engineering. I wanted to build things for others. </p>

<p>With the announcement of the App Store 2009, I started learning iOS development and published my first series of apps in 2011 when I was 16 years old. It was a side project for me; it was something fun to do.</p>

<p><strong>Little did I know, the App Store and the iPhone would change my life. </strong></p>

<p>Back then, no one really had iPhones. My dad got an iPhone 3G around 2010 and I thought it was great. I was able to get an iPod Touch when it came out, and was active with my friends who “jailbroke” their iPod Touches. There was no App Store, but as an avid follower of Apple, I was excited about the App Store when it came out. </p>

<p>About a month later, I tried to develop and app with my friend Dylan who had a Mac computer at the time. We failed and it took another year for me to do anything. I teamed up with my friend Jake. He was an artists and would design the apps, I would code them. Both of these kids also went to middle school with me. It was a great partnership, and we published one free iOS app and one paid iOS app. <strong>The apps were mediocre, but I had downloads all over the world. </strong>There was something great about the immediate gratification of the internet. In one day of the app being on the store, I could see all the regions where the app was downloaded. I though that was incredible, that a 16 year old could have this capability. </p>

<p>By junior and senior year of high school, I was taking physics and chemistry. In both subjects, I was not the best student in my class. I couldn’t see myself succeeding in these subjects later in life, so I felt challenged. I had a strong interest in building things, but other students got higher grades than me in Physics and Math. By the time I applied to college, I was ready to take the leap. With my interest in app development, I applied with a desire to do a Computer Science and Business double major. What you figure out quickly is that business is not theoretical, so it’s something you have to learn in the real world. By the time I arrived at college, I had lost any interest in formally studying business. </p>

<p>Ever since I was around 14, I had a grasp on coding. I mostly used the Arduino kit — which was a microprocessor for electrical engineering students to learn the basics. Thanks to the support of my parents, I was able to get my hands on a board (a $25 kit) when I was 14. The Arduino opened me up to the world of electronics, coding, and science. I thought it was great. However, I had always coded <em>for science</em>. I did not think I could make a career from it in the traditional sense. </p>

<h2>Internship Strategy for 2014</h2>

<p>Before I even got to Rochester, I was thinking about what I wanted to do the summer of 2014 (the summer after my first semester at Rochester). With encouragement from a current Rochester student, I applied to a program that fall called <strong>HackNY</strong>. I was enamored by this fellowship, it was exactly what I wanted to do. Here’s the description of the fellowship:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hackNY aims to federate the next generation of hackers for the New York innovation community. Co-organized by faculty from NYU and Columbia, hackNY has since February 2010 organized the hackNY Fellows program and hackNY student hackathons during the school year in order to create and empower a community of student-technologists.</p>

<p>The summer Fellows program pairs quantitative and computational students with startups which can demonstrate a strong mentoring environment: a problem for a student to work on, a person to mentor them, and a place for them to work. Students enjoy free housing together and a pedagogical lecture series to introduce them to the ins and outs of joining and founding a startup.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each summer, they would take 40 kids and pair them with startup company in New York City. I had no formal experience with a job; I worked as an intern as my uncle’s engineering firm, but that was it. However, I loved to make things, and I knew that the fellowship was a place I wanted to be. Having two students complete the fellowship before me was a boost to my ego. It definitely helped me think that it was achievable. </p>

<p><strong>I put a lot into networking.</strong> I was sure to ask other kids who had completed the fellowship what their thoughts were.</p>

<p>Applying to the fellowship was an initial justification that I could make a career from app development. As a 17 year old in a new industry – where the industry was only five years old – you don’t have any awareness of what “real life“ would be like. At the time, I was being rewarded more of app development and less for science. All of my science classes became difficult, and app development was a creative outlet that I was actually good at. </p>

<p>Around January, I had gotten to the finalist round for the fellowship, but I really had no expectations beyond that. <strong>In February while I was at school in Rochester, I got accepted to the fellowship. </strong> I was sure to keep good correspondence with the person who managed all of the applications. This helped me feel more comfortable about getting positive responses. </p>

<p>While I had known I got into the fellowship, I was uncertain about the “pairing” process with a company. I set out to skip the pairing and directly find a company to work at. </p>

<p>I did something smart that would benefit me three months later. At Fairfield in Fall 2013, I started sending awkward emails to companies that I admired. These were simple emails, but probably unique for one of these employees to receive. I would talk about my projects, my interests, and mention that I was looking for an internship that summer. </p>

<p>Being from Connecticut, I knew that I wanted to work in New York City that summer. I was interested in startup companies, so I scoped out all of my potential options. I was fascinated by a very well-known startup studio called Betaworks, which had produced several well known companies. One day, I emailed their head of investments asking about summer intern jobs. Over the next few months I tried to communicate with him about potential options. He would shoot me from company to company, seeing if that company needed a developer that summer. Nothing came up.</p>

<p>I was able to connect with a venture capital firm, and they referred me to a few of their portfolio companies. One of the companies was Plated.com. Back then, they did not have a mobile team, but I met them in their New York City office in March of 2014. <strong>I had no formal software engineering work experience.</strong> That day I walked into the door, not expecting anything, and got a nearly complete positive reaction from the employees. Because they did not have a full iOS team (maybe one person), there was no true interview process. <strong>This team was ready to hand me a 3 month internship working on an initial iOS product at Plated.com with no prior work experience.</strong> I thought the idea was cool, but I still had my interests set on working at Betaworks. </p>

<p>Often freshman are very timid about job applications because they believe they have no experience. While they may have less real-world experience, ambition and drive can make up for most things. And these companies know that. Perhaps you do need experience for more stressful jobs, but many companies will enjoy a student who has passion and drive and perhaps little work experience. You’re 18! You are not expected to be the President of the United States.</p>

<p><strong><em>Another thing, I would recommend applying to companies with an interview process. If they don’t have a full technical interview with you, it is likely going to be unstructured.</em></strong></p>

<p>It was getting late in the spring, and I still had not decided to work for Plated. I was holding out for something better. During dinner one night in April, I emailed one of the Betaworks companies called Instapaper. It was a popular read-it-later service and their main product was an iOS app. I found one of the main engineer’s emails through Twitter and sent him a link to my portfolio. He actually ended up being very receptive. A few days later, I had an non-technical interview at a Starbucks off-campus from school. I sent him a link to the repository of an app I worked on. He really liked it, and I think the timing was right. <strong>There was no formal acceptance but I got the job offer.</strong> It was a huge weight off my shoulders, and that summer I would be working for Instapaper at Betaworks. </p>

<p>What was a quaint motivation back at Fairfield turned into a real world job. I had made a few connections and the summer was ready for the internship and the fellowship. Not too bad, if it weren’t for the last few months of school at Rochester.</p>

<p>In April, I also applied to Apple’s World Wide Developer’s Conference — a yearly gathering for iOS developers. After writing the application and completing an iOS app as part of the requirements, I got accepted. The conference would be free to attend, but I would still have to pay for a plane ticket and lodging. Overall, these three things were an incredible uptick to my first semester at Rochester. But most things at school did not happen like this.</p>

<h2>Outside of School vs. Inside of School</h2>

<p>As you can tell, outside of school was going well. I was able to do what most freshman had not planned for yet. I had an internship lined up in New York City, I had gotten into a fellowship that was going to pay for my housing, and I got a ticket to the Apple World Wide Developer’s conference. </p>

<p>Most of these positives happened towards the end of my first semester. </p>

<p>Going back to those first few, cold weeks in January, I was far from elated. I struggled to make friends those first few months. All of these negative feelings were compounded by my performance in school. I knew that college classes would be difficult; but I had succeeded getting a high GPA at a difficult high school, so I was surprised at first. My worst class was Calculus. </p>

<p>My first formal Computer Science class was nothing short of traumatic. I loved programming and building software, but this intro class made me question the entire field. This class was boring, theoretical, and impractical. At home, all of my work in coding was practical. I was shipping mobile apps to a few hundred people as a teenager. People directly saw the results of my actions. <strong>My introduction to Computer Science was about lecture slides rather than making a difference in people’s lives.</strong> I am not discounting the field. My expectations for Computer Science in college were just very different from what they actually were. Yes, I should not have expected as much from my first college Computer Science class, but this set the precedent for all other CS classes I would take. <strong>“This is not the field I signed up for!“ I thought to myself. </strong>Computer Science was the key to the kingdom. It was something that had unlocked my potential, my creativity, my soul — and now I struggled to find how introductory Computer Science was relevant at all. This was not the same subject that inspired me like those teenage years in my parent’s basement.</p>

<p>I would not love Computer Science until I got past the first few introductory classes, but getting there was hard enough. </p>

<h2>Moving to New York; HackNY Fellowship</h2>

<p>Before I started my internship at Instapaper, maybe during a school break one weekend, I was able to walk around Union Square with my soon-to-be manager. He talked about the things he wanted to get done that summer. It was very exciting because it was the first time I could see app development being a real job. </p>

<p>I had never lived in a big city before, so this was new to me. At the end of my first semester at home, I went home to Connecticut and packed my bags to make the move. My fellowship provided housing in an NYU dorm with the 30 other students completing the program. I was able to interact with a lot of people here. Most people were older than me, since I was a freshman. I felt really special to be in the situation. I was very inspired by Humans of New York, a popular Facebook photo blog. The creator, Brandon Stanton, had come to our school in March. I think it was one of his first formal talks, and the entire thing was really intriguing. The idea was that he would walk through random streets in New York, photograph people, and tell there stories. This would inspire a lot of my work during the summer. </p>

<p>Every Tuesday and Thursday, we could go to a different company like Facebook, Microsoft, or The New York Times, and hear an educational talk about the company. It was designed to help introduce us to joining or starting a technology company. </p>

<p>The summer was great. I was getting paid to do something I genuinely enjoyed. It was the first time I had felt like the real world was finding value in my skills.</p>

<h2>HackNY Fellowship Interviews</h2>

<p>A few days a week, I would walk around Union Square park outside of our building an interview the people who were doing the fellowship with me. At the time, I felt they were all more talented than me, so I thought doing interviews and publishing them online would be really beneficial. I also thought that a lot of people in the community would see a benefit from them. It’s always great getting to know these people, especially in a more in-depth way. I have taken the liberty of copying each interview below. You can feel free to skip this section if you want want to read these interviews. Keep in mind, they are all Computer Science students living in New York City for a summer doing this fellowship. <strong>There was a ton to learn from them, and these interviews were one of my best decisions.</strong> I hope you can benefit from the interviews too, so you’ll find them in the appendix. You can navigate them by the title, and you can skip to the people who you find most interesting. </p>

<p><strong>All of the interviews I conducted are available at the bottom of this document.</strong> They are really useful snapshots of students in the middle of exploring careers in Software Engineering. </p>

<h2>Mental Health Problems</h2>

<p>During the summer of 2014, I was doing really well. I was doing an amazing fellowship program, I was living in the best neighborhood in New York, and I had a job that was exactly what I wanted to do. For some reason, I still felt upset, mostly because I would have to return to Rochester in the Fall of 2014. Around three weeks before my internship would end, I went back to my parents home in Connecticut which was only two hours away from the city. <strong>Almost anyone else in the world would love to be in my position, yet I still felt terrible all the time.</strong> </p>

<p>I felt fine that weekend. However, in the car on the way back to the train station, I nervously asked my dad a question: “Do you ever feel sad sometimes?”</p>

<p>That was an inflection point towards opening up about my issues with mental health. I was uncertain about my future because I wasn’t sure if I wanted to stay in college. I thought there may be another path, but thinking about returning to Rochester as a sophomore was not exciting at the time. </p>

<p>After expressing my mental state to my dad, he was able to setup several therapy sessions when I went back to New York City. The therapist’s office was on 9th street, which was only a 10 minute walk to where I was living in Union Square. </p>

<h2>Visits with the Therapist</h2>

<p>I had never seen a therapist before. That morning around 9 o’clock, I searched the block for his building. I got tea before it to make myself more comfortable. I entered the building an found my way up the rickety old elevator. The hallways were white and very thin. I feared around the corner and saw someone leaving from a door. I assumed it would be some sort of office so I walked in. </p>

<p>I was expecting a receptionist, but there was just a small waiting room. There were a few artificial plans, some magazines, and two chairs in a dimly lit room. </p>

<p>For some reason I felt like I needed to prove myself to the therapist. After the first session, I sent him an email with my accomplishments. I told him all of the good things I was doing. I felt a need to prove myself to this person, to show him that I was on the right path from a success standpoint. </p>

<h1>Year Two: Closing the Doors; Who Am I?</h1>

<p>The summer of 2014 closed with more questions than answers. I was <strong>so</strong> enamored and in love with my summer in New York City doing the fellowship. </p>

<p>For the first time, I found that someone could pay me to write code. Someone could pay me to do the thing I enjoyed doing. It was like playing in a sandbox, and I was encouraged to do it!</p>

<p>I knew I disliked Rochester, so I returned that Fall thinking about more options than staying there. Could I study abroad, take time off, or transfer? </p>

<p><strong>One-by-one, I was watching my friends drop out of college to pursue jobs in technology. </strong> </p>

<p>The terrible feelings I felt at my first semester of college inspired me to study a topic I had a vague interest in – psychology. It ended up being one of the best decisions. At first, I took the classes because I assumed I could get higher grades than doing Computer Science and Math classes. </p>

<h2>How Has it Been?</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, a friend asked me about my college experience. I was able to come up with a short metaphor that did not make any sense at the time, but in retrospect, offers some insights. I stated: A lot of my college education has been &quot;throwing me in the middle of a lake and watching me swim to the shore.&quot;</p>

<p>My college experience was heavy weighted. It was not good. But it was not bad either. Paradoxically, it was good in a bad way. For some reason, my college experience was about “weight lifting” instead of freely being supported and encouraged to follow my interests. It taught me what I needed to know for the next stage. </p>

<p>After four years, college was full of questioning the fundamentals of who I was. It said, “you are this person not this person”. It striped me down and build me back up. It challenged me to really figure out myself, what I’m here to do, and where I can go. All of that happened through mistakes. In high school, I assumed I knew who I was. It wasn’t until college where I realized I had no idea about myself. It is really hard to know yourself unless you have experiences. Those experiences become part of your integrated sense of self. They become properties of you just like hair color or eye color. The best part of life is that it’s ever-changing. </p>

<h2>What did I do wrong in choosing Rochester?</h2>

<ol>
	<li><strong><em>If I had known the expectations of the field I am in, I would have gone to a school that was less expensive.</em></strong> Although my family could manage the tuition (with loans and other things), the $30,000 extra to go here instead of a “good” public or private university at a lower price point really would not have made much difference. Colleges are <strong>not</strong> like Hotel Rooms, where you get a nicer room the more you pay. A higher tuition school does not equate to a higher paying job at graduation. It is about the investments that you make in yourself and the things you have access to. Sure, a resume with Stanford on it will give you a leg up, but beyond that, I wouldn’t have been so choosy. Just make sure the foundations are good. </li>
	<li><strong><em>I would choose a more vibrant location.</em></strong> There is no greater contrast — socio-economic status, ethnic makeup — than the University of Rochester and the City of Rochester. The campus is surrounded on all sides by the Genesee River and a cemetery. It is an island separated in all ways from the surrounding community. You could put this campus in any other city in the U.S.A., and it would still function normally. You need night-life, bars, malls, parks, attractions and other things in college to make life bearable. Choose a location like this. </li>
	<li><strong><em>Choose a college close to a hub.</em></strong></li>
	<li>You can find great, smart, loving, kind people are every good college. I do not think my school is above average in this regard. </li>
	<li><strong><em>Ethnic Diversity on Paper != Visible Ethnic Diversity on Campus</em></strong>. There are 2 black men in my fraternity of 40 people. Almost no POC’s beyond them. Even though there are many races on campus, they rarely interact, if ever. American, Chinese, Korean, African, and Mexican students silo themselves, most of the time. The University rarely does things to bring them together. </li>
	<li><strong><em>Most things are not utilized to their full potential</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>HackNY Interview: Walter Menendez goes to MIT works at MongoDB in Times Square</h3>

<p><strong>Where&#39;d you grow up?</strong></p>

<p>I was born in Los Angeles. My parents broke up when I was young and my mom remarried. Growing up, my mom was a housekeeper. We moved to Maryland and my mom commuted back and forth to Washington DC working two jobs. Growing up, I was the only one who learned English proficiently. When I went to school, I had to speak English. Then in order to communicate with my parents, I had to speak Spanish.</p>

<p>I remember when we got our first computer at the home when I was around 8 years old. My parents didn&#39;t know anything about the internet. for school, all our assignments were posted on the internet. I think my curiosity pushed me a lot to just explore what the computer did. I would tinker around with different things. At some point, my parents realized they could not help me as much as they wanted to. When I would do homework, they would watch me do it to make sure I did it but they knew they could not help me learn it.&quot;</p>

<p>In high school, I went to a very academically challenging magnet school. Everyone around me had it figured out. They had 4.0s and 2400 SAT scores. When it came time to apply to college, I was a first generation college student. My parents knew they could not help me a lot, but they promised to sign any forms and pay for tests. After talking to colleges, all of the colleges I got into promised to give me most of the cost off. I ended up getting into Stanford, Brown and a couple other places. They saw my financial situation and were willing to help me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I chose MIT because I wanted to be at a place where I could just explore and absorb information. I tried to do that in high school but MIT was really a place where I could meet people and be somewhat free to explore things.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s your biggest struggle right now?</strong></p>

<p>I want to take advantage of the time I have during my last year at MIT. A lot of what affected me growing up was my mom&#39;s attitude towards me. She wanted me to have a better life, so she did everything she could to do that. I feel an obligation to help her and give back in the work I do in the future.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give to the person you were 4 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>Four years ago, I was a rising senior in high school and planning out where I would apply to college. Knowing everything will work out in the end is very important. Because no matter which way life turns, everything will be okay in the end.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself in 4 years?</strong></p>

<p>I was an intern at Tumblr last summer; I am doing HackNY and MongoDB this summer. In the future, I want to be working somewhere with data science. Alternatively, I love music and the impact music can have on people. My dream job would be Spotify. They are doing some really interesting stuff with machine learning and recommendations. What I&#39;m doing at MongoDB right now is more server side than I would like. At&nbsp;my heart, I am a web developer so I want to build products that people find value in.</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Kyle Johnson, goes to Rutgers University and works at&nbsp;Cafe.com&nbsp;in NoMad</h2>

<p><strong>Where did you grow up?</strong></p>

<p>I was born in New Brunswick, NJ. Ironically, it is right next to my college. I have one brother and sister, they&#39;re both younger than me. I grew up in the same school system. I did a lot of sports growing up. I looked at colleges for track and field. Mostly, I was looking at business programs. I only applied to one tech related college program. Computer science is my minor, but my major is Information Technology.</p>

<p><strong>Do you remember a transformative moment in your childhood?</strong></p>

<p>&quot;I took a class that was for Art Majors at Rutgers. The class was for HTML and CSS that helped you design a basic site. I took the class and ended up making a video game. I started taking more web design classes and eventually got more into developing. I went to the Dominican Republic in high school with my family but mostly ditched them to go explore on my own. I ended up meeting some really cool people. I had never been outside of the country before then. It was the most accepting place I have even been. It was a very human and organic thing.&quot; Since then I have been to London, Paris, Russia and South Africa mostly because of that experience.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s you&#39;re biggest struggle right now?</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m in a transition period where I have to do &quot;real world things.&quot; I don&#39;t really have a rock. I&#39;m 21 years old and I can&#39;t say my parents really know me. My family split up a few years ago. Since I was the oldest, I had to take a lot of the burden. I was the only one of my siblings who was really understanding what was going on. I felt like it would be selfish to demand a lot out of my parents when I was applying to college. I perpetuated an image of myself that would appease them. It&#39;s felt like I needed the support of my parents to do a lot of things. I didn&#39;t want leave my siblings alone and go succeed on my own.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give the person you were 4 years.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to do something for yourself now and again. It&#39;s hard to me to justify putting myself in the &quot;first&quot; position of priority when there&#39;s other people or situations involved. I&#39;m likely to put a personal desire aside to put the needs of others ahead of mine. I&#39;m getting used to separate myself from others, so I can explore my interests for myself. There were few times where I could say I accomplished something solely for myself. Now, I&#39;m making an effect to accomplish things for myself.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself going in 4 years?</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel passionate enough right now to do &quot;Plan A.&quot; But I definitely have a &quot;Plan B and C.&quot; I&#39;d like to work at a startup whose product has some value to me. I want to be at a place in my life where I&#39;m intrinsically valued. I&#39;d love to be at a point where I have enough value that I can share with others, like mentoring. I just want to do enough to be able to share.</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Kyle Ryan, goes to University of Rochester, works at Instapaper – a Betaworks company.</h2>

<p><strong>‘Where did you grow up?’</strong></p>

<p>I moved to Connecticut when I was two and spent 95% of my childhood there. I went to a small, 150 person, catholic school and that was my entire world. I liked the people I was with, but didn&#39;t want to spend all my time with them, so I commuted 20 miles west to go to an all boys Jesuit high school; it was the best thing I ever did.</p>

<p>I really differentiated myself early on, but no one ever pushed me in High School. I did a lot of stuff on my own because I felt like I didn&#39;t get any support in the things I loved growing up. I generally felt out of place, disincentivized to do the things I loved. There are a lot of areas where I can’t possibly be the best at something, but I want to find that niche where I can be. I was an only child growing up, and I think that changed a lot of things for me; Einstein once said, ”The monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind.” Growing up, I was always making things because I was so bored. That creativity continued escalating, and now I’m here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have no idea why I&#39;m alive; I&#39;ve been trying to find my purpose for a while. I still feel different, but the internet was really instrumental in helping me find like-minded people.</p>

<p><strong>‘Will being the best make you happy?’</strong></p>

<p>I think happiness comes as a result of fully developing your abilities and maximizing your potential. I created a law for myself that in order to be happy I need to fully evolve my creative abilities. I&#39;m trying to figure out if I&#39;ll ever get to a point where I&#39;m happy with my position; I may believe there is some better position I can get to. I struggle to know if I&#39;ll ever find my purpose or if I&#39;ve already found it. I&#39;m super worried about time and death; I wonder, if this were my last day, would I want to be doing what I&#39;m doing right now? For the past few years the answer has been a resounding yes.</p>

<p><strong>‘Is part of the reason that you&#39;re doing these interviews is to find that place you fit in?’</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, that, and finding my position in relation to these 37 other really smart people. Are they having the same struggles? Are they doing better than me? Are they going to be more successful than me? I think I&#39;m a good position. I haven&#39;t talked to everyone yet but everyone is struggling with these questions of having ideas, creating them and finding happiness. I haven&#39;t figured out the happiness thing yet, but I don&#39;t think any of us have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think of success and failure any more. I only think of value and a lack of value. Failing right now means I go back to school and get a degree. That’s not exactly failure, it’s more like not fully developing my abilities.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you can be content. I think it&#39;s a curse. If I become content or satisfied, I&#39;ll stop being able to make really cool things. The reason I can create is because I&#39;m not ok with my current position. It&#39;s a really difficult struggle; I can&#39;t be ok to be ok.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the last year alone my perspective of the world shifted. This year I&#39;ve felt like I&#39;ve had two big perspective shifts. As I go forth I&#39;m hoping more and more of those perspective shifts happen. I feel a little a directionless; I&#39;ve thought a lot about leaving school, and I&#39;m still not certain about what the best opportunity for me is. Not knowing is, understandably, terrifying. A lot of my friends are leaving school, and I wonder should I leave too.</p>

<p>I think I can make myself happy by building things that make other people happy. That&#39;s why I&#39;m building tools that help us experience other people’s lives...because that’s valuable to me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Matt Condon, goes to Louisiana Tech works at Magnetic in Chelsea</h2>

<p><strong>Where&#39;d you grow up?</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Grew up in Louisiana. I had a few struggles growing up. Most of my time was spent around Louisiana area. I went to Louisiana tech mostly because it was free for me. Up until now, I was an EE and Physics major. But now after doing HackNY, I’m going to switch to being a CS major.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s your biggest struggle right now?</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Time is really a struggle. I think we all have felt that. There’s so many possible routes I could go on. I just want to do “everything” but know that I can only do one or two of those things with the time I have. It reminds me of the proverbial triangle between Friends, Academics and Family.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Mostly, I just stopped worrying. I spent most of my high school worrying about failure or about getting good grades. Once I stopped worrying and caring about what other people thought of me, I was free to do the things I’m doing now.&quot;</p>

<p>Where do you see yourself 4 years from now?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably figure out how to take a quarter off of school to work at a place like Digital Ocean. I&#39;d want to do an internship every winter quarter until I graduate. That way I am able to get experience while still going to school.</p>

<p>Everything I&#39;ve done, and even though this sounds crazy, points to building an exoskeleton suit like Iron Man. It’s the perfect combination of everything I love – electrical engineering, computer science and physics. If i’m able to be involved in something like that, I would extremely enjoy it.&quot;</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Quinn Liu, goes to Virginia Tech, works App Nexus&nbsp;</h2>

<p><strong>Where’d you grow up?</strong></p>

<p>I moved so many times when I was younger. I was born in China then moved to Colorado, Missouri, Canada, Virginia and then now Texas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I grew up loving to draw things. My dream was to move to New York City and be an artist. I remember one time growing up in Missouri, an artist came to my middle school and drew a Lion for me. There was a girl I wanted to impress. When I got home and my mom asked me what I did that day, I showed her the picture of the lion and said that I had drawn it. I didn&#39;t really. So for the next few weeks, my mom paraded me as the boy who drew the really good lion picture. Since the artist drew it quickly, it looked like I could have done it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For many years up until college, I kept getting better at art to prove that I could be just as good as the person who drew the lion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, I really admire my Dad. He was a food delivery man back in China. I remember riding in the car with him back when I was younger. I would be eating food in the back while he was delivering things. He moved us all to America. Now, he&#39;s a Professor at Texas A&amp;M teaching Agriculture.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Do you remember a transformative moment in your childhood?</strong></p>

<p>I visited China back in high school. When I was at a shopping mall, I had lost the person I was with. The thing I thought best to do was go towards the exit and wait for them there — since there was only one exit. While I was there, I noticed a book store. I never grew up speaking Chinese, so I went to the English section of the bookstore. Here, I found a book about the brain and neuroscience. I immediately fell in love with it, and transitioned to wanting to do things with the brain. When I came back, I started reading books by a man named Jeff Hawkins who studied how we could make technology that emulates the brain. Since then, I&#39;ve dedicated myself to learning about the brain and trying to recreate it in software.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What’s your biggest struggle?</strong></p>

<p>There was always this fantastic excitement I got from first starting my projects and research. What I struggle with is keeping up this excitement as time moves on. It&#39;s really hard. There was a point where I stopped doing research for 3 months but picked it back up. It&#39;s always a challenge to keep my curiosity going.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>Four years ago, I had no idea I wanted to do what I&#39;m doing now. I thought I wanted to do art. I would say that I should spend more time with my family. I would make my mom a meal for all the meals that she has cooked for me.</p>

<p>I see a lot of my friends who are really intelligent but think that their body is only a mechanism for getting their brain from place to place. I think it&#39;s really important to nourish your body and keep it healthy. So even though you should focus on doing work, your health should come first.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself 4 years from now?</strong></p>

<p>My goal has always been to learn as much about the brain as I can. I am continually working to try to recreate the brain through software and computers. I think AI is one of the most interesting fields. I could see myself working with some really great people in that area. Maybe I could do research at a company in this area. It&#39;s exciting.</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Deepak Kumar, goes to University Of Michigan works at REDI (a startup spun out of Goldman Sachs) in the Financial District</h2>

<p><strong>Where&#39;d you grow up?</strong><br/>Born in India and moved eventually to Michigan. My parents were engineers so they were always teaching me different things. I had access to a lot of books and was an encouraged to go into math early on. At the same time, I picked up music and singing. By the time high school ended, I knew I wanted to go into some form of engineering.</p>

<p><strong>Do you remember a transformative moment in your past?</strong></p>

<p>As part of my university, everyone in engineering takes a computer science class. I had never done programming until college. After my first class, I fell in love with it. I took a codecademy class and that helped a ton.</p>

<p>But the realizations came when I attended a college hackathon called PennApps at UPenn. I had the worst time there. Everyone said &quot;go to hackathons and you&#39;ll learn everything.&quot; I went and I had no idea what I was doing. Everyone around me didn&#39;t really help that much. My team was just &quot;there.&quot; After that, I saw the huge reward of getting into computer science, so I dedicated myself to learning it.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s your biggest struggle right now?</strong></p>

<p>Not enough time.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>Be completely open to doing new things.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself going in 4 years?</strong></p>

<p>I see myself going to grad school for a little while. I&#39;ll probably look to join a large startup or a company and learn as much as I can there. Then, I&#39;d like to do my own thing.&quot;</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Patrick Facheris, goes to Columbia University, works&nbsp;Magnetic.com</h2>

<p><strong>Where’d you grow up?</strong></p>

<p>I was born in Belgium. We moved to the US when I was young so I don&#39;t have any memory of Belgium. I lived on Anna Maria island just off the coast of Florida for most of my life. I remember spending a lot of time with my grandparents. My dad was a designer, so he worked a lot with illustrator. We had a G3 Mac, as I remember. I had a Macintosh, one of the early versions as my first computer.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you remember a transformative moment in your childhood?</p>

<p>I thought I wanted to be an architect growing up. I had a teacher who told me I had an &quot;engineering mind.&quot; I ended up doing a lot of things in Physics thinking I wanted to be a physicist. I did a High School science research program as part of Baylor University my junior year. When I was there, we did a lot of cool stuff. Technically it was research on &quot;bilayer complex plasmas.&quot; Which means space dust in a plasma that gets charged and lines up and does weird things. Anyways, a lot of people there did things on the computer. They used computer code, so after that, I took a Computer Science class online.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your biggest struggle?</strong></p>

<p>I really want to do my own thing (a startup). Although, i&#39;m not sure if I need to work somewhere to get experience first so I can do it. I have trouble knowing what the &quot;right&quot; path is. Should I do this startup thing or work at a company for a few years. I&#39;m really interested in machine learning and applying my skills there.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>Four years ago, I was really focused on getting into a good college. I wouldn&#39;t say that I shouldn&#39;t have done that. Sometimes I did things just so they looked good on my resume. However, I think if I were to do it over again, I would still do things for college, but do things that I also really enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself 4 years from now?</strong></p>

<p>I really want to travel a lot. My parents traveled the world when they were younger, but when I was growing up, they never wanted to travel. I&#39;d love to go to Asia and study Buddhism. Although, I really want to be in New York. It&#39;s a struggle. At the same time I want to travel, I want to have a place in New York and be somewhat financially secure. I would be happy in almost any situation really. I&#39;m motivated to be the guy who does &quot;a lot of things really well.&quot; Startups and tech is really against people who don&#39;t have a specific skill in &quot;one&quot; area. However, I want to change that.</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Sruti Modekurty, goes to Carnegie Mellon University, works Birchbox in the Flatiron District</h2>

<p><strong>Where’d you grow up?</strong></p>

<p>I was born in India but my family moved to California when I was a baby. Pretty much grew up in the suburbs of Sacramento. I have a younger sister, my dad’s a hardware engineer and my mom did some software stuff in a past life before becoming a full time mom. My family is full of engineers and doctors. I have a lot to look up and live up to!</p>

<p>My dad would teach me stuff sometimes, like taking apart a computer. From an early age I knew I wanted to do something with computers.</p>

<p>I was pretty lucky because I joined a robotics team in middle school. I continued it throughout high school and that pushed me into engineering.”</p>

<p><strong>Have you had any new revelations in the past few years?</strong></p>

<p>I realized the world is never going to be perfect. But I can still make an impact. I figured out that I do have the capability to change the world for the better, I think everyone does. Some people just act upon it more than others.”</p>

<p>What’s your biggest struggle?</p>

<p>I’m always battling time. There are so many things I want to do and experience but I feel like I never have enough time. But sometimes I’m doing too many things, and I lose sight of what truly matters.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>“Four years ago I was in high school and I was incredibly shy. I was so afraid of talking to people. The advice I would give myself is be confident. Don’t let your insecurities define who you are or who you think you can be. You think people are noticing things about you, but really, they are too wrapped up in themselves.”</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself 4 years from now?</strong><br/>There’s so much potential to use technology in a high impact, meaningful way. I feel like some startups are too focused on making incremental changes to the lives of people who already have a nice life. I want to use technology to save and really improve lives. I’m still figuring out how to do that.</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Catherine Moresco, goes to University of Chicago, works at Oscar Health in SoHo</h2>

<p><strong>Where did you grow up?</strong></p>

<p>Howell, NJ. It’s a small town in central Jersey. We lived in Howell almost my whole life. We moved once about a block away. I have one sister who is older than me, and when I was 10 we adopted two kids from Ukraine. I was homeschooled for 5 years, so I was in a really sheltered environment. I transitioned to going to public school which was very traumatic. We all know how welcoming elementary school kids are.</p>

<p>I was ahead academically when I transferred. When I was homeschooled, I didn’t have video games or anything, so I read a lot of books. My older sister was a huge influence. I didn’t get into Computer Science until later. I taught myself Python in high school, but didn’t start taking CS until my second year of college.</p>

<p><strong>What is your biggest struggle?</strong></p>

<p>I would call it “self-confidence.” I need to convince myself that i’m well suited to the task at hand. I tend to fail to internalize my own accomplishments. It’s basically the imposter syndrome. Usually I do just fine, but it’s still something that I get anxious about.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>I was probably sleeping this moment 4 years ago, haha. I was a lot more uptight about grades. I was your stereotypical “oh my god, I have to be valedictorian and get good grades.” I guess I wanted to get into a good college. I’ve always been a huge perfectionist.</p>

<p>I would tell them to stop worrying so much. I’ve stopped worrying about my grades. Because in the end, everything will be all right.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself going in 4 years?</strong></p>

<p>I still have 2 years left of college so I don’t know if I should get a job in tech or go to grad school. As cliché as this sounds, my biggest goal is just to wake up every morning and love what I do. That’s where I want to be.</p>

<h1>HackNY Interviews: Garrett Parrish, former Freshman at Harvard University transferring to MIT in the fall, works at Foursquare in SoHo and BMuse in Greenwich Village</h1>

<p><strong>Where’d you grow up?</strong></p>

<p>I was born and raised in Boston. I grew up in a very unstable household and from a very humble financial situation. I went to public school and always had a wider perspective on the world because of what I had experienced. Early on, I made a choice to not let my past hinder me and to make something good and meaningful out of my life. Instead of turning to drugs or anything like that, I found engineering and music. The combination of my will to live a better life and the need for financial aid drove me to work towards schools like Harvard and MIT because I knew that they’d be supportive and would lead me to a more successful life. But beyond that, I’ve always wanted to be a Disney Imagineer because I think that those people are putting so much good into the world and teaching children to believe in magic and solidarity. Especially after seeing so much cruelty and pain when I was younger, the will to eradicate that and make the world a safer and more supportive place is prevalent in everything I do.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your biggest struggle?</strong></p>

<p>“For me, it’s really difficult to tread the line between doing what you need to in order to survive and doing ‘exactly’ what you want to do. For example, at Harvard, there was this constant dichotomy between working towards my career and pursuing my other interests — there really just wasn’t any support for interdisciplinary work or the types of things I was interested in. I felt that I couldn’t simultaneously do what I needed to do to set myself up for a successful career while pursuing my other interests. That combined with a disappointing engineering department, a social culture that just wasn’t right for me, and a fantastic academic opportunity at MIT, I had little reason to remain there. For me, experiencing and resolving that struggle will be one of the defining moments of my life.”</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>Four years ago, this month, I was playing Billy Flynn in Chicago at Middlesex School of Summer Arts, where I was striping on stage in the opening song. I had never done anything technical before and couldn’t imagine I’d be where I am now. <strong>My advice:</strong> Really get over any of the insecurities with asking for help. Don’t worry about being competitive with other people. So many people fall into that trap. If you’re too proud to ask for help, that’s such a problem. Keep perspective on every situation. Know that there’s a million different perspectives. Go to New York a lot more. Every time you go there, you realize there’s a massive world out there and that you’re this little insignificant spec.”</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself in four years?</strong></p>

<p>In four years, I want to be completely comfortable and proficient with my technical abilities. There’s a million things you can learn and I’m not good enough yet to just whip out a prototype really quickly. I want a foundational technical knowledge so I can basically go do anything. When you play an instrument, you learn the technique so you can express yourself and there is a stream of emotion and consciousness from your brain through your instrument. I want that same feeling, but with technology. I also just want much more exposure to humanities. I just want to know what else is out there and to be able to communicate and work with anyone from any discipline.</p>

<p><strong>What type of path should people be on?</strong></p>

<p>Regarding the whole startup/tech scene, I think the movie “The Social Network” has put people on the wrong path. As someone who has been on the ground at Harvard, I can see how they have sexualized the whole thing and completely blown it out of proportion. They basically told kids that if they learn to code, drop out of college, make a crap-load of money, sleep with girls, and make an internet startup, they’ll have succeeded — that’s what science and technology is being portrayed as leading to. To me, that’s the completely wrong way to look at it. Whatever you main goal, it needs to be deep-seated and genuine and literally be bursting out of your soul. It has to be something where you’re positively impacting people. Something to help the world psychologically. The biggest and most important problems now are all social. For example, what AirBnB does is not just give people a cheap place to be, it is making people actually trust one another, which I think is a much more important social impact. If you were lucky enough to be born in a situation where you have the tools and opportunities that people like I have, it’s your obligation to help and contribute to the lives the other billions of people in the world. It’s an obligation, not a choice.</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Alex Wheeler, Boston University, works at ChallengePost in the Meat Packing District</h2>

<p><strong>Where did you grow up?</strong></p>

<p>I was born in Santa Monica, California and then moved down to Laguna Beach. Spent most of my life in Laguna. I have a fraternal twin brother and a younger brother. Laguna is a small beach, surf town. There&#39;s no tech community there, so Boston and my University was a huge influence on me. My dad got a CS degree back in the 1960s, but it wasn&#39;t like I grew up in some sort of techie household.</p>

<p><strong>Do you remember a transformative moment in your life?</strong></p>

<p>Last summer, I moved to Santiago, Chile for three months. We ended up scoring this super cool government contract. We were programming, surfing and drinking good wine. I remember being up super early in the morning sitting on my balcony and wondering how I got here. Living in South America is a whole different world.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s your greatest struggle right now?</strong></p>

<p>You have all these friends growing up and people go different places. It gets really hard to maintain those friendships. I still think we don&#39;t find enough time to just “hang out.”</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>I was a senior in high school four years ago. I was 180 degrees different. I was not involved with tech at all. My freshman year, I had this awesome roommate, Anthony, who was a CS major. I always remember coming home from class and hanging out with friends wondering what this guy was doing all day on his computer. I was so confused. I found out that he was working on these cool projects. My interest just took off from there.</p>

<p><strong>My advice:</strong> Try as many things that interest you. It takes an hour out of your day. If you find something that you keep coming back to, just stick with it.”</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself in the next 4 years?</strong></p>

<p>This comes out of my time in South America: I see myself in the future as a “technological pirate.” I&#39;d love to go into developing countries that are still building out their infrastructure and help them out through technology. How cool would it be to go to some wild, remote country and motivate people to make things that can drastically improve their quality of life. Most of the world is still developing. I love people who go to these obscure places and come out with a story. That&#39;s where I see myself in 4 years... A Tech Pirate.</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Jamis Johnson, Columbia University, works at Seen.co in SoHo</h2>

<p>&quot;I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah. I was raised Mormon and was one of 6 children. I had a wonderful <em>smiles</em> childhood. Tons of mischief, like burning Christmas trees in a fire. We also put a porcupine in a girls van one time.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you remember a transformative moment in your childhood?</p>

<p>I lost a lot of my religious beliefs around 7 years ago. I went to China for 3 months when I was 19 years old. I was alone the whole time and traveled over 4000 miles. I actually snuck into Tibet and they kicked me out. I went from being in a small city to country of a billion people. Completely different.</p>

<p>“In a mirror.” <em>laughs</em></p>

<p><strong>If you could give one piece of advice to yourself 4 years ago, what would it be?</strong></p>

<p>4 years ago I was 23 and working on my startup. I&#39;m 27 now. I would tell myself to move to New York City. I would say: Do the things that will get me to the place I am now, faster.</p>

<h2>HackNY Interview: Lisa Luo, Dartmouth College, works at Kickstarter in Brooklyn</h2>

<p><strong>Where&#39;d you grow up?</strong></p>

<p>I grew up in Boston and moved every 5 years. I kind of moved from apartment to apartment. It was hard growing up. The rest of my family was born in China, and I was the first born in America. By the time high school rolled around, I found a program that helped me get into a better middle school. Eventually, I picked up rowing and went to Dartmouth to row. Eventually I got injured. By chance, I stumbled into CS around 2 years ago. My life has turned a lot of chapters.</p>

<p><strong>What motivates you right now?</strong></p>

<p>If I don’t like something, I won’t do it. I do what I want to do. My parent’s had a lot of struggles, so I want to “be something,” for them. Family is really important to me. I went back to China by myself for 4 months to visit the other side of my family. In terms of motivation, I won’t try hard to succeed, but I will work hard to find happiness.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself in 4 years?</strong></p>

<p>Four years ago, I was very structured. Now, I’m not consistent at all. I don’t order the same smoothie twice. I don’t eat the same cereal twice. I don’t plan for the future really.</p>

<p><strong>If you could give one piece of advice to yourself 4 years ago, what would it be?</strong></p>

<p>Being a competitive rower, I became accustomed to being afraid of time. I’d tell myself that you don’t always need to give someone an explanation for why you do something. I know it’s cliché, but “be yourself,” and try not to be influenced by what others want you to be. I try to live without regrets. I don’t know where i’m going but I know how to get there. And that is a weird feeling.</p>

<h2>HackNY Interviews: Calvin Chan, UCLA, works at Skillshare in SoHo</h2>

<p>I was a drummer growing up. I went to a hackathon one time. After that, I just kept building things. I wanted to go to UCLA for the band, but now I&#39;ve changed and I&#39;m writing a lot of code and making cool things instead.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself in 4 years?</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably be living in some foreign country or traveling and integrating completely in the culture. I don&#39;t want to say I&#39;d be a hermit, but yea.</p>

<h1>QA</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Should I be good at Mathematics to be good at Computer Science or Software Engineering?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s tackle this question in two parts. </p>

<p><strong>For Computer Science:</strong></p>

<p>As a CS undergrad, you have to go through Discrete Mathematics, Calculus, and maybe Multi-variable or Linear Algebra. In that sense, you have to be good enough to pass and or do well in those classes. Like anything, you just have to focus and learn the material. If you don’t get an “A” in these classes, do not worry. Also, do not feel like these classes will predict your success in CS. </p>

<p>I really enjoyed my finite math class. Finite math is completely different than algebraic and calculus-esque math that I had in high school. Finite math also felt much more applicable to the real world (i.e. cryptography, graph theory, probability). </p>

<p><strong>For Software Engineering:</strong></p>

<p>Unless you want to do machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, or Data Science, you do not necessarily have to be good at mathematics. However, you should be <strong>really</strong> good at two things related to math: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Symbolic manipulation </li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow">Control Flow</a></li>

<p><em>Symbolic Maniuplation</em></p>

<p>By symbolic manipulation, I am referring to your ability to take an abstraction (a symbol) and transforming that symbol into other symbols over time. Your brain should be wired to take a symbol “A”, and think, “What happens when I put an A into a B machine or a C machine. How does A change?”. I am obviously talking about functions, recursion, and control flow in programming. </p>

<p><em>Control Flow</em></p>

<p>Another really good thing to get your head around in relation to math is the idea of control flow. It is a foundational concept in most imperative languages. I don’t have to explain it here, you can go read up on it. It’s a pretty basic aspect of computing. Early Computer Science has its foundations in mathematicians. So under-the-hood, mathematics is the foundation of the field. I actually wrote a paper about it <a href="http://deskofkyle.com/writing/CSC_242W_Paper_1.pdf">here</a>.</p>
