<h1> Cultural Obsolescence </h1>

<!-- What makes you unique. You shouldn't be ashamed that culture changes. "Ok Boomer". Cultural change is neccessary and a good thing. Cultures changes over time. We shouldn't fear or avoid cultural change. -->

<p>The pace of technological and cultural change these days is blindingly quick. Cultural trends and technological gadgets from just a few years ago are obsolete. </p>

<p>As I grow older (I’m 25 years old), my generation is the next to become out of touch with its younger generation. For me, the generational gap became apparent after I graduated college. Soon, Generation Z was on the scene. They had grown up with iPhones instead of desktop PC’s. They had never known dial-up modems, CDs, video cassettes, or GameBoys that I used in the late-90s and early-2000s. Even their cultural icons are different. Instead of famous soccer players or band members as their role-models, they idolized their favorite YouTube vlogger or TikTok-er. </p>

<p>If you expand this logic to past generations, you would probably find the same pattern. These cultural dynamics seem to be accelerating since the 1950s. Trends rise and fall more quickly. Consider this: How do you view culture and technology from 1920?</p>

<p>Words like, “primitive”, “junk”, or ”obsolete” come to mind. This leads to one important observation: the way I view 1920s culture (i.e. music) is the way my descendants in 2120 will view my culture: obsolete. But what does this mean? Why is it important? And how does it impact the types of systems &amp; technology we should create?</p>

<p>Steve Job’s answer to this question was something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the work I have done in my life will be obsolete by the time I’m 50. You’re building up a mountain, and you get to contribute your little layer of sedimentary rock to make the mountain that much higher. But no one on the surface, unless they have x-ray vision, will see your sediment. They’ll stand on it. It’ll be appreciated by that rare geologist. But no, not like the renaissance at all – very different. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expanding this past 100 years becomes even more interesting. What does cultural and technological change look like beyond my great-grandfather’s generation? My 28,100 BCE great-grand-father had primitive tools and feared for his survival. My 1,100 BCE great-grand-father had access to primitive means of production, farming, and agriculture. By 1700, my great-grandfather had seen the beginnings of an industrial revolution. My great-grandfather witnessed the depths of WWI. By my grandfather’s time, a post-great depression culture cemented his outlook on life. Then my father, born in 1961, had experienced corporate life and the Information Age. As a child of the 90s, I was able to experience and participate in the Internet Age. </p>

<p>No culture or technological progress exists in a vacuum. On a logarithmic scale, it is easier to visualize the arc of cultural changes. I would recommend this article, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/your-family-past-present-and-future.html" title="Your Family: Past, Present, and Future">Your Family: Past, Present, and Future</a>, which visualizes the vastness of your historical family tree. </p>

<p>Seeing the genetic tree that led to your birth is powerful. The 21st century’s pace of technological change is different than before. If you choose to have kids, your genetic chain will lead to livelihood for someone (as the author’s example states) like Telia.</p>

<figure><img src="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/telia-cone.png"/></figure>

<p>She lives in 2300 and is your great-+5-granddaughter. The generational branching factor is a powerful reminder of how many ancestors each person has in common. Each ancestral generation takes <code>2^n</code> people (where n=the number of past generations). One generation back required two people (your parents) (<code>2^1=2</code>). Two generations before that required four people (your maternal and paternal grandparents) (<code>2^2 = 4</code>). But for your great-grandparents, <code>(2^3) = 8</code>), your existence required eight people. As the author states, if any of those eight people did not have a child, you would not be alive. </p>

<p>We can see how fragile the genetic chain becomes. But it is also telling how Telia (your great-+5-granddaughter) cannot tell the difference between all of her Level 7 (n=7) ancestors. There are 128 ancestors on the seventh ancestral level. It is clear that each generation has a vastly different experience, but how does that influence our understanding of technological and cultural progress? For me, it demonstrates the importance of influencing the type of world Telia will live in (Ex: advocating for minimized pollution, respect for nature, more parks, better healthcare, better mental health). </p>

<h1>Take Aways</h1>

<p>Each of this points takes into account the obsolete nature that current culture and technology will have within the next 100 years. </p>

<ol>
	<li>Protect and preserve what makes your culture and technology unique. Share that culture and technology with your children and grand-children. </li>
	<li>Learn about and appreciate the culture of your ancestors. </li>
	<li>Leave the world better than you found it. Telia will have to live in it too. </li>
</ol>

<h1>P.S. </h1>

<p>I leave you with a quite depressing Stoic quote: </p>

<p>“The age of Vespasian, for example. People doing the exact same things: marrying, raising children, getting sick, dying, waging war, throwing parties, doing business, farming, flatting, boasting, distrusting, plotting, hoping other will die, complaining about their own lives, falling in love, putting away money, seeking high office and power. <strong>And the life they led is nowhere to be found.</strong> Or the age of Trajan. The exact same things. And that life too –&nbsp;gone.”&nbsp;–&nbsp;Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Book 4</p>
