<h1>Generational Obsoletism </h1>

<h3>The accelerating pace of technological and cultural obsoletism</h3>

<p>The pace of technological and cultural change these days is blindingly quick. Cultural trends and technological gadgets from just a few years ago are obsolete. </p>

<p>As I grow older (I’m 25 years old), my generation is the next to become out of touch with its younger generation. For me, the generational gap became apparent after I graduated college. Soon, Generation Z was on the scene. They had grown up with iPhones instead of desktop PC’s. They had never known dial-up modems, CDs, video cassettes, or GameBoys that I used in the late-90s and early-2000s. Even their cultural icons were different. Instead of famous soccer players or band members as their role-models, they idolized their favorite YouTube vlogger or TikTok-er. </p>

<p>If you expand this logic further to past generations, you would probably find the same mechanic. Notably, these cultural dynamics seems to be accelerating since the 1950s. Trends rise and fall more rapidly. Consider this: How do you view culture and technology from 1920?</p>

<p>Words like, “primitive”, “junk”, or ”obsolete” come to mind. This leads to one important observation: the way I view 1920s culture (i.e. music) is the way my descendants in 2120 will view my culture: obsolete. But what does this mean? Why is it important? And how does it impact the types of systems &amp; technology we should create?</p>

<p>Steve Job’s answer to this question was something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the work I have done in my life will be obsolete by the time I’m 50. You’re building up a mountain, and you get to contribute your little layer of sedimentary rock to make the mountain that much higher. But no one on the surface, unless they have x-ray vision, will see your sediment. They’ll stand on it. It’ll be appreciated by that rare geologist. But no, not like the renaissance at all – very different. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expanding this logic out further past 100 years becomes even more interesting. What does the pace of cultural and technological change look like on a logarithmic scale beyond my great-grandfather? My 28,100 BCE great-grand-father likely had primitive tools and feared for his survival. My 1,100 BCE great-grand-father probably had access to primitive means of production, farming, and agriculture. By 1700, this great-grandfather had seen the beginnings of an industrial revolution and domestic slavery. My great-grandfather witnessed the depths of WWI and a growing economy. By my grandfather’s time, a post-great depression culture cemented his outlook on life. Then my father, born in 1961, had witnessed and participated in corporate life and the Information Age. As a child of the 90s, I was able to experience and participate in the Internet Age. </p>

<p>No culture or technological progress exists in a vacuum. On a logarithmic scale, it is easier to visualize the arc of progress. An impactful article that demonstrates the vastness of your historical family tree is titled: <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/your-family-past-present-and-future.html" title="Your Family: Past, Present, and Future">Your Family: Past, Present, and Future</a>. I highly recommend you read it. </p>

<p>Seeing the genetic chain that led to your existence is pretty powerful. It is even more powerful in the sense that this period (the 21st century) of rapid technological change is different than before. If you choose to have kids, your genetic chain will lead to a livelihood for someone (as the authors example states) like Telia.</p>

<p>She lives in 2300 and is your great-+5-grand-daughter. The generational branching factor is a powerful reminder of how many ancestors each person has in common. Each ancestral generation takes <code>2^n</code> people (where n=the number of past generations). One generation back required two people (your parents) (<code>2^1=2</code>). Two generations before that required four people (your maternal and paternal grandparents) (<code>2^2 = 4</code>). But even by your great-grandparents, <code>(2^3) = 8</code>), your existence required eight people. As the author states, if any of those eight people did not have a child, you would not be alive. </p>

<p>We can see how fragile the genetic chain becomes. But it is also telling how Telia (your great-+5-grand-daughter) cannot tell the difference between all of her Level 7 (n=7) ancestors. There are 128 ancestors on the seventh ancestral level. It is clear that each generation has a vastly difference experience, but how does that influence our understanding of technological and cultural progress? For me, it demonstrates the the importance of type of would we ultimately want Telia to live in (Ex: clean air, minimized pollution, respect for nature, more parks, better healthcare, better mental health). </p>

<h1>Take-Aways</h1>

<p>Here are my take-aways about how my obsoletism can influence my daily life. Each of this points takes into account the relative obsolete nature that current culture and technology will have within the next 100 years. </p>

<ol>
	<li>Protect and preserve what makes your culture and technology unique. Share that culture and technology with your children and grand-children. </li>
	<li>Learn about and appreciate the culture of your ancestors. </li>
	<li>Leave the world better than you found it. Telia will have to live in it too. </li>
</ol>

<h1>P.S. </h1>

<p>I leave you with a quite depressing Stoic quote: </p>

<p>“The age of Vespasian, for example. People doing the exact same things: marrying, raising children, getting sick, dying, waging war, throwing parties, doing business, farming, flatting, boasting, distrusting, plotting, hoping other will die, complaining about their own lives, falling in love, putting away money, seeking high office and power. <strong>And the life they led is nowhere to be found</strong>. Or the age of Trajan. The exact same things. And that life too –&nbsp;gone.”&nbsp;–&nbsp;Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Book 4</p>
