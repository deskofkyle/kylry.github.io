I'm an iOS & Software Engineer at [Strava](http://strava.com). I graduated from the University of Rochester with a degree in Computer Science and Psychology in 2017.

# Extended Bio

With the announcement of the App Store 2008, I started learning Objective-C and published my first series of iOS apps in 2011 when I was 16 years old with a friend in his parent's basement.

Currently, I study Computer Science and Psychology under the Hajim School of Engineering & Applied Sciences at the University of Rochester. I will complete a double-major degree this year in December 2017.

This summer, I was a software engineer intern at Strava – the social network for athletes. I was a teaching assistant for University of Rochester’s first iOS Swift course in 2016. In 2014, I worked at Instapaper where I helped ship Instapaper 6.0. Instapaper was acquired by Pinterest last year.
