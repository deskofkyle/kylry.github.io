As I am finishing college soon, I thought it might be useful to talk about how I evalute the things I work on.

I think this topic gets more important as time goes on in life. We spend 30-50 years of our life in non-leisure time. We make decisions all the time about this.

Time is money, but your account balance is always hidden. Your account balance is also being continually depleted. You can never make more time, but you can certainly make one "dollar" of time worth more than another "dollar".

Can I uniquely add value to this
Could I be more dedicated to this than most other people
Could this work matter in 5-7 years
