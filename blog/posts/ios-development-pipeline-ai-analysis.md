AI tools make big promises to revolutionize coding, but my day-to-day reality is more nuanced. Every developer seems to have strong opinions about AI - either it's amazing or useless. Here are my grades based on real iOS development work.

Below, I've graded AI performance across common iOS development phases that we encounter daily.

## My iOS development AI Report Card July 2025

| Stage | Grade | Reality Check |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **PRD** | A- | Great for boilerplate, covers edge cases |
| **Tech Spec** | B | Good for suggesting blindspots |
| **Architecture** | C+ | Suggests patterns, not philosophy, needs a human |
| **Coding** | A- | Solid Swift/SwiftUI, handles codegen |
| **Local Builds** | C | Suggests fixes, can't execute code |
| **Unit Tests** | B | Useful tests, sometimes brittle |
| **Code Review** | A- | Catches bugs, misses business logic |
| **CI/CD** | C+ | Writes configs, mostly manual setup |
| **QA Testing** | C | Plans tests, can't execute |
| **Beta Testing** | C | Analyzes feedback, can't reproduce |
| **App Store Submission** | C- | Metadata help only |  
| **App Store Review** | F | Zero access |
| **Distribution** | F | No certificate access |
| **Monitoring** | B+ | Excellent for logging or analytics analysis |
| **Product Support** | D | Can automate common triage, but is not fully integrated |

**Overall iOS Development Grade : C+**

As we can see, AI has strong performance in code generation but struggles with Apple ecosystem-specific tasks that we face every day.

## The Mac Access Problem

**Cloud AI agents** (Devin, Cursor Background Agents, etc.) run on Linux servers and can't access the macOS tools we rely on. They can call local build commands, but their environment is limited until they are able to run xcodebuild commands. They're limited to code generation without the compilation or testing we need.

**Local AI agents** (running on our Macs) can theoretically compile Swift and run simulators, but most lack integration with Xcode, device management, and Apple's development tools that we use daily.

Without proper Mac access or toolchain integration, most AI agents can't help us with:

- Compile and verify Swift code
- Run iOS simulators 
- Test on devices (Yes, there are some AI tools for this)
- Execute complete Xcode builds (Unless using CI/CD)

## Daily Reality

Here are some areas where AI currently can't help me with the iOS specific tasks we face:

**Device-Specific Debugging**: App crashes on iPhone 12 but works on iPhone 15? AI suggests causes, but I'm testing across devices and reproducing edge cases.

**Xcode Build Issues**: AI reads error logs, but when builds break from dependency updates or signing problems, I'm mostly doing manual troubleshooting.

**App Store Rejections**: Apple rejects for "In App Purchases", AI helps rewrite descriptions but can't navigate appeals or act on Apple's requirements.

**Real Hardware Testing**: Simulator works, device testing is mostly manual. AI lives in perfect conditions - it can't deal with thermal throttling, low battery, and background refresh.

**Certificate Management**: Provisioning profiles expire before releases? AI can provides docs, but I handle Apple Developer accounts and CI/CD updates.

The pattern is pretty clear so far: AI excels at knowledge-based tasks but struggles when real-world constraints emerge. In iOS development, these constraints represent the majority of challenges we face daily.

## The Final Grade

AI today is strong at documentation and code generation, but it's weak at Apple ecosystem integration and real-world deployment that we deal with.

I gave it a C+ grade: valuable for specific tasks, but we still need human oversight for production apps.

## Looking Ahead: AI in 2030

Current limitations stem from ecosystem access and execution capabilities. What could change for us:

**Apple Integration**: Direct access to Xcode, App Store Connect could boost distribution/submission grades from F/C- to B+.

**Execution**: AI agents running builds and tests could turn C-grade tasks into A-level performance.

**Device Testing**: Cloud device farms with AI could raise testing grades from C to B+.

**Ecosystem Knowledge**: More training on Apple guidelines could improve App Store tasks from C-/F to B.
